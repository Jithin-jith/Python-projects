      "The studying of the Indian Sources will develop an insight into the unique\n",
      "qualities of Indian art that is best achieved through a broad Cultural History\n",
      "which places art production and patronage in its social and cultural context.\n",
      "Introduction:\n",
      "India is a multi- cultural sub- continent resulting from a history of migrations of\n",
      "diverse Peoples and the establishment of the new communities. They came\n",
      "from as far as Greece and Asia Minor in the West and the borders of China in\n",
      "the east. The people often arriving as invaders or travelers carrying their\n",
      "baggage with them were gradually absorbed into Indian Culture. These\n",
      "constant infusions enriched the Culture and their values were powerfully\n",
      "modified in India. There is no contradiction between the diversity of regions,\n",
      "religions, castes, languages and the unity of shared experiences that\n",
      "separates India from the surrounding countries.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "The inscriptions on Asoka’s rock and pillar edicts are earliest examples of\n",
      "Indian writings. The Buddhist Reliquaries too had such inscriptions. Though\n",
      "the religious literature was handed down orally the few records provide us an\n",
      "opportunity to understand the very roots of the society in general. Brahmins\n",
      "had committed the Vedas to memory. There were learned monks who knew\n",
      "by heart but it is through the oral recitation and dialogue that the pupil learnt it\n",
      "by heart and got himself educated. It is also of importance to understand that\n",
      "the Buddhist canon was also not written until the reign of the Sinhalese\n",
      "monarch Vattagamini in 29 B.C. Some of the other significant works that shed\n",
      "light on the Sources of Indian History are the Jataka Stories, the inscriptions\n",
      "the Brahmi and Kharoshti texts, the narratives and the folk lores or legends.\n",
      "The latter though give an idea but cannot be taken as genuine sources or\n",
      "authenticate the Historical evidences.\n",
      "Subject Matter:\n",
      "Sources of Indian History differ considerably in different periods. Broadly three\n",
      "periods are observed: The Ancient Period to 12th Century; 13th to 18th\n",
      "Century and 19th to Subsequent period.\n",
      "The Ancient Period:\n",
      "The Literary sources pose various lags where the absence of regular\n",
      "historical chronicles and the records of the kings that are prejudiced on the\n",
      "base of patronage and self- elation. There is dependence on rise and fall of\n",
      "States and Nations. The Vedic texts are important sources that need to be\n",
      "looked into for attaining a clear picture of the social, economic and religious\n",
      "beliefs of the then society. The other religious texts available in their texts too\n",
      "form important sources like the Buddhist, Jain, etc. The songs\n",
      "and poems bespeak of the state of mind of the people and the kind of\n",
      "freedom they could exercise in their lives. Many a time there are available\n",
      "Genealogies of the Royal families and their personal records that reflect the\n",
      "mind of the ruler and his subjects. The Epics like the Ramayana and\n",
      "Mahabharata 1500- 1000 B.C. are important records as they too shed light on\n",
      "how people lived.\n",
      "Important writers like Banabhatta through his Harsha carita give us a detailed\n",
      "account of the life of King Harsha. The poet Vakpati’s work Yasovarman was\n",
      "King centric and the work of poet Bilhana and the stories of the King\n",
      "Vikramaditya form significant records of the general life practices. Similar\n",
      "works are available like Vikramanka Deva Carita, Gaudavaho, Ramacarita,\n",
      "etc. Noted biographical works like Kumarapala carita of Jayasimha,\n",
      "Dvyasraya Sahasnka carita of Padma Gupta, Bhojaprabhandha by Ballala,\n",
      "Prithviraja carita of Chand Bardai, Prithviraja- Vijaya all contain valuable\n",
      "Historic information. The perspective the researcher needs to take is that\n",
      "prejudiced and biased opinions cannot be stamped as genuine History as\n",
      "their sole object was glorification of the King. They were conceived by the\n",
      "authors on a dictate by the King. Chachanama 13th Century is a well- known\n",
      "chronicle of the Sind which formed the basis of History of Asoka.\n",
      "Another chief source on the History of Kashmir is the work of Rajatarangini by\n",
      "Kalhana in A.D. 1149-50. The works of Sage Nila i.e. Nila Purana. Kalhana\n",
      "gives an in- depth study of how kings ruled as per the chronological order\n",
      "Inclusive of criticism of men and events, judgment and the topographical\n",
      "interesting accounts. The Jain Rajatarangini by Srivara covers the period A.D.\n",
      "1459- 86. In the chronicles of Gujarat Rasa mala, Kirti kaumudi of\n",
      "Someshvara, Sukrita Samkirtana of Arisiniha, Prabhandha Cintamani by\n",

      "Udayaprabha, Vasanta Vilasa of Balachandra, etc. I\n",
      "Archaeology:\n",
      "The archeology includes the records and tabulations available to us from\n",
      "various sites.\n",
      "The inscriptions form an important source to uncover the Political History of\n",
      "Ancient India. The engravings on stones and metal are to be considered\n",
      "contemporary document of the period it belongs to. Sometimes the dates are\n",
      "given either in records or inscribed on the surface. Kharoshti script is derived\n",
      "from Aramaic runs from Right to Left and Brahmi Script Left to Right.\n",
      "Prasastis or slab of stone many a time hold inscribed: the name, donations\n",
      "made along with the date. For example the Aihole inscription of Pulakesin II\n",
      "provides much proof. Official and epigraphical records too need to be looked\n",
      "into.\n",
      "The Numismatics essentially highlights the coins found from the archeological\n",
      "sites. This provides us with the knowledge of the metal used where studying\n",
      "the Economic conditions of the society becomes easier. Dye casts, symbols\n",
      "and punch marks help us in identifying the craftsman and the king who had\n",
      "given the patronage. The religious beliefs of the people too come to light if the\n",
      "coin carries the motif of a Deity or has a name inscribed on it. The coins might\n",
      "provide information but that does not authenticate the Historical evidence. For\n",
      "example the coins of Alexander or Kushana, Wima Kadphises, Kanishka,\n",
      "Guptas, etc. can be seen for identifying the motifs they had utilized..\n",
      "The Monuments form an important record of the life and spirit of the Ancient\n",
      "India. For example the Sites of Harappa and Mohenjodaro, the granaries and\n",
      "dwelling areas unearthed at Lothal, Dharma Chakra Shaped stupa from\n",
      "Sanghol in Punjab, and several sites can be quoted for example that are now\n",
      "under the Archaeological Survey of India.\n",
      "Foreign Accounts:\n",
      "The travelers, traders, invaders, pilgrims, etc. who had come into India to\n",
      "conquer, settle or study have left authentic accounts that will help in tracing\n",
      "the Socio- Political History. There were a number of Greek writers who arrived\n",
      "in India. Herodotus and Ctesias have Persian base. Megathenes has left an\n",
      "extensive study under Seleucus during the rule of Chandra Gupta Maurya.\n",
      "The defect with the records is that many a time the foreign travelers did not\n",
      "have knowledge of the customs, language and life of the people they were\n",
      "writing about. Periplus of the Erythraean Sea has several records of the ports,\n",
      "harbors and the merchandise. The spirit of exploration, adventure and the\n",
      "enthusiasm of the unknown land had led the records interesting yet\n",
      "historically incorrect. Arab Sailors like Sulaiman, Al Masudi too have\n",
      "maintained their records. Chinese Travelers Fa- Hien in 5th Century, Hieun\n",
      "Tsang and I-Tsing in 7th Century have rich records, experiences and\n",
      "dialogues with the intellectuals in India. IN the accounts of these travelers the\n",
      "Rituals, Practices and Memorials too can be studied. Abu Rihan, Al Beruni in\n",
      "8th Century has given a Survey of the Indian Territory. He gives a detail on\n",
      "Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Literature, Cosmogony, astronomy,\n",
      "astrology, geography, philosophy, religious rites, customs, social ideas, etc.\n",
      "For example let's consider one such scholar al-beruni commissioned by\n",
      "mehmood of jhazni to produce his monumental commentary on Indian\n",
      "philosophy and culture.In his search for pure knowledge he is undoubtedly\n",
      "one of the greatest minds in Islamic History.Romila Thapar a prominent writer\n",
      "calls him \" perhaps the finest intellect of Central Asia\". His observations on\n",
      "Indian conditions ,systems of\n",
      "knowledge, social norms and religions are probably the most incisive made by\n",
      "any vistor to India.He applied his talents in many fields of knowledge.Excelling\n",
      "particularly in astronomy,mathematics,chronology, Physics,\n",
      "Medicine,mineralogy and history.Al-beruni wrote his work on India to provide\n",
      "essential facts for any Muslim who wanted to converse to Hinuds and to\n",
      "discuss with them questions of relgion ,science and literature.In his accounts\n",
      "he highlights the choice parts of the Geeta, the Upanishads, Patajali,Puranas,\n",
      "the Four Vedas, scientifc text by Nagrajuna, Arybhata etc.Many stories from\n",
      "Indian mythology also became a part of his study.He compared Indian\n",
      "thoughts to the Greek thought of Socrates ,Pythagoras,Plato, Aristotle and\n",
      "others.In his accounts he highlights the works on astronomy, he discussed\n",
      "with approval the theory of the Earth's rotation on its axis and made accurate\n",
      "calculations of latitude and longitude.In those on physics he expalined natural\n",
      "springs by laws of hydrostatic and determined with remarcable accuracy the\n",
      "specifc weight of precious stones and metals.\n",
      "For better understanding of Al-Beruni let's see in detail how we view a\n",
      "particular travler.First and foremost we understand the influences of\n",
      "his surroundings.Al-beruni was influenced by Aristotle, Ptolemy,\n",

      "Islamic world.He is given the titles -The founder of indology and the first\n",
      "anthropologist.He also made contributions to earth sciences and is known for\n",
      "significant contributions to geography.The word 'Beruni' means outer district in\n",
      "Persian language.That s why he is called Al-Beruni. Briefly through the\n",
      "understanding of one example we get to know how the travellers, writers,\n",
      "scholars and other intellectuals need to be understood for the study of the\n",
      "sources available to us. The clarity of thought is developed by intense\n",
      "concentration on the subjects that we read and the sharpness of the mind of\n",
      "these scholars as they approached the subject. The other sources like we\n",
      "have seen before are the archaeology, inscriptions, numismatics and\n",
      "monuments which need to be carefully studied for a profound understanding\n",
      "of the subject.\n",
      "Medieval Period:\n",
      "Accounts of Muslim Turks too have been made. Tabaqat- i- Nasisri by Minhaj-\n",
      "ud- din, 13th Century A.D. traces the History of the Muslim Rule in India.\n",
      "Many of the other sources are Tariq- I- Firuz Shahi by Ziya-ud- din- Barani\n",

      "enlightened emergence of Guru Nanak who revolutionized the very concept of\n",
      "religion and who provided spiritual and divine balm and solace to the wounds\n",
      "of this society, which was reeling under the spell of caste, creed and\n",
      "ignorance. It is aptly written “Satguru Nanak Pragatya Miti Dhund Jag\n",
      "Chaanan Hoya”. With his divine message the whole world was lit with the light\n",
      "of the knowledge and ignorance was dispelled.\n",
      "While throwing light on the contribution of Guru Nanak some basic and\n",
      "general questions which often come to our mind are: From which region of\n",
      "India Guru Nanak hailed? What is the essence and inner message of Guru\n",
      "Nanak’s teachings? What is his contribution as a reformer and as a preacher?\n",
      "What was his necessity behind founding a new religion? What is the source of\n",
      "inspiration to learn about the prevailing popular religions and How he\n",
      "describes religion in three main principles?\n",
      "Guru Nanak was the founder of Sikh religion and the first of a succession of\n",
      "ten Sikh Gurus or prophet-teachers and disseminator of the divine intimations\n",
      "vouchsafed to him and became the source of a powerful current of spiritual\n",
      "and social renewal and regeneration. The birth of Guru Nanak Dev in this\n",
      "manifest world is considered a very vital event enriching its religious history\n",
      "because the principles, doctrines, beliefs and tenets he preached in the\n",
      "universe are related to the complete transformation and welfare of the entire\n",
      "mankind and are in no way limited to any one caste, clan, community. The\n",
      "Guru came on to this world like the sweet vibration of pure and pious entities\n",
      "through his sweet and loving words. It can also be said that Guru’s universal\n",
      "mission of compassion, love and peace like beautiful fragrance of a flower\n",
      "saturated the environment with its ecstatic sweetness.\n",
      "Guru Nanak through his invaluable utterances and sweet persuasive\n",
      "arguments made mankind aware of the futility of hollow rituals and useless\n",
      "superstitions, which have least relevance with the spiritual nobility of a\n",
      "religion. He therefore made them retract from idol worship of the deities of\n",
      "various gods and goddesses and instead get united to the Absolute One.\n",
      "Because of his gigantic efforts he brought mankind nearer to the Divine on the\n",
      "one hand and created the spirit of equity and equality among humans on the\n",
      "other hand, so that feeling of universal brotherhood and fraternity prevail and\n",
      "of differentiation and discrimination abolished and also mutual love, trust and\n",
      "affection sprout as well as flourish.\n",
      "HIS BIRTH AND EARLY LIFE:\n",
      "Guru Nanak was born on Baisakhi sudi 3, 1526 Bk/ 15 April 1469 A.D. at Rai\n",
      "Bhoi-Ki-Talvandi, now called Nanakana Sahib, 65 km southwest of Lahore in\n",
      "Pakistan. As predicted, he showed exceptional interest in cosmic questions\n",
      "and fundamentals of life when yet a child. His father, Kalian Chand, more\n",
      "commonly known as Mehta Kalu, belonged to the Bedi clan of Kshatriya\n",
      "Hindus. He was a patvari, i.e. village accountant, in the service of Rai Bular,\n",
      "the local Muslim chief, and also had a few acres of his own on which he\n",
      "raised cattle. Guru Nanak’s mother was Tripta Devi and he had one elder\n",
      "sister, Bibi Nanaki who became a spiritual figure in her own right.\n",
      "According to the Janam Sakhis traditional accounts of Guru Nanak’s life, the\n",
      "birth of the child was attended by prodigies and prophecies of his coming\n",
      "greatness. The village priest, Hardyal was sent for to cast his horoscope. The\n",
      "pandit spoke very auspicious words about the child. He prophesied that he\n",
      "would not only be an adorer of God, but also lead many others to Him. Nanak\n",
      "was a precocious child, who at the age of five, asked questions about the\n",
      "purpose of life, and who, when sent to a pandit to learn the alphabet,\n",
      "surprised his teacher by composing an acrostic poem with a deeply\n",
      "philosophical and mystic import. On the other hand, he is pictured as a\n",
      "dreamy child often indifferent to his studies and inattentive to everyday duties.\n",
      "He let the cattle entrusted to his care wander into a farmer’s field and\n",
      "tramples his crop. Money given him for business was distributed to the poor or\n",
      "to wandering ascetics and described by him as ‘Sacha Sauda’ (good bargain).\n",
      "Starting in childhood and throughout his life there are reports of Guru Nanak’s\n",
      "seeking the company of Hindu and Muslim holy men. His loving parents and\n",
      "sister were delighted to learn about his brilliance, but worried by his laxness in\n",
      "the tasks of daily life. In response to their concern it was suggested that the\n",
      "boy should be married. As an unfailing remedy to keep along the worldly path\n",
      "his father married him in 1487 to a girl named Sulakhni, daughter of a man\n",
      "called Mula in Batala. Two sons were eventually born to them, Sri Chand and\n",
      "Lakshmi Chand.\n",
      "GURU NANAK’S LIFE AT SULTANPUR:\n",
      "For her strained father’s relief, Nanaki, Nanak’s sister, took Guru Nanak to\n",
      "Sultanpur where her husband, Jairam managed for him storekeeper’s job at\n",
      "Daulat Khan Lodi’s Modikhana. He fulfilled his duties and won the admiration\n",
      "of everyone for his diligence. He gathered a group of disciples for the worship\n",
      "of the one God and meditation on the divine Name. A Muslim minstrel,\n",
      "Mardana, companion of his childhood days, joined him at Sultanpur, where\n",
      "they organized the singing of hymns, the sharing of a common meal and\n",
      "urging people to a life of simplicity and righteousness.\n",
      "Guru Nanak was now thirty years old and had been at Sultanpur for seven\n",
      "years. Every morning he went to the local river named River Bein for his daily\n",
      "bath. One morning, he did not return. When searched, he was found missing,\n",
      "though his clothes lay on the river-bank. Everybody concluded that he had\n",
      "drowned. But he reappears the third day. He was set deep within him and his\n",
      "face glowed with a unique brilliance. He was now an Enlightened One. He\n",
      "kept introspecting the whole day. The next morning he re-iterated the principle\n",
      "of universal brotherhood: “Nai koi Hindu na koi Musalman” and with it\n",
      "advanced his vision of harmony, tolerance and unity. He announced to the\n",
      "world the good news of life lived in communion with the one God who is\n",
      "beyond the religious divisions created by humankind. Leaving his family\n",
      "behind and taking Mardana with him as his sole companion, he left Sultanpur\n",
      "for twenty years of traveling. He was now a faqir, traveling from one holy\n",
      "place to the other, from one of the Hindus to that of the Muslims, or the Jain or\n",
      "the Buddhist, within the country and beyond.\n",
      "TRAVELS OF GURU NANAK:\n",
      "It is difficult to establish an exact itinerary of Guru Nanak’s travels.\n",
      "Customarily they are grouped into four lengthy journeys as Udasis to the east,\n",
      "south, north, and west. At the end of each, he returned to the Punjab. While\n",
      "his travels took him also to many obscure hamlets, Guru Nanak traveled as\n",
      "well to the centres of religious pilgrimage. His dialogue with pandits, sadhus\n",
      "and yogis of every sect, as with mullas, pirs and qadis was not that of an\n",
      "uncommitted seeker, but that of a teacher. As the Janam Sakhis report, Guru\n",
      "Nanak possessed uncanny powers, which he used to challenge the religious\n",
      "leaders of his time. He visited the places of pilgrimage at Kurukshetra,\n",
      "Mathura, Haridvar, Banaras, Gaya, as well as those in Bengal, Assam and\n",
      "Ceylon (Sri Lanka). He also visited the Sufi establishments at Pak Pattan and\n",
      "Multan and shrine sites along the west coast of India.\n",
      "He traveled beyond India in the west to Mecca, Medina and Baghdad. There\n",
      "are accounts of still further travels to the east, to Tibet and China. There are\n",
      "legends of travel to mythical places such as Mount Sumeru. Guru Nanak’s\n",
      "first formal disciple, the Sikh, was Bhai Lalo, a carpenter from Sayyidpur in\n",
      "Gujranwala, now in Pakistan, a place he had chosen to begin his itinerancy.\n",
      "Guru Nanak traveled to Sialkot thenafter and met the known saint Shah\n",
      "Hamzah and to Achal Batala, and discoursed on theological matters with\n",
      "yogis and wise ones gathered there on Shivaratri. At Talwandi, he went to pay\n",
      "respects to his parents and in the way to Multan halted for sometime at\n",
      "Chhanga Manga forest to meditate and at Chuniana to meet Sheikh Daud\n",
      "Karamati and Sayyid Hamid Ganj Baksh. The saints at Multan sent him a\n",
      "bowl filled with milk to its brim suggesting that Multan already had many saints\n",
      "leaving him no place. Nanak sent back the bowl with a jasmine flower afloat\n",
      "indicating that his fragrance-like presence would only add fragrance to\n",
      "Multan’s life. Here he met Sheikh Ibrahim and the head of Baba Farid’s\n",
      "shrine. He reformed the notorious Sajjan Thag.\n",
      "For twelve years he was in eastern part, visiting Kurukshetra on solar-eclipse\n",
      "ablution, Mathura, Vrindavan, Agra meeting saints, Faqirs, holy ones, pandits\n",
      "and maulavis teaching great ideals of love, truth, honesty and inward purity.\n",
      "At Kamrup, Nur Shahi, the known conjurer, tried to infatuate Baba Nanak by\n",
      "her extraordinary tempting charms, but her ignorance was shedded off the\n",

      "Dear students today we are going to study in brief the origin and development of\n",
      "Sufi Movement which had impacted spiritual and religious fabric\n",
      "of India right from 8th to 16th century and radically revolutionalised the very meaning of\n",
      "spirituality, divinity and humanism.\n",
      "While studying the concept and development of Sufi movement a few basic and\n",
      "questions arise in our mind such as: what do we understand by the term Sufism? What\n",
      "are the fundamental perceptions derived from this movement? What are the various\n",
      "stages of spiritual thought in Sufism? How Sufism has impacted our cultural, social,\n",
      "religious and spiritual values? Which are the main Sufi Orders and who were the\n",
      "prominent Sufi saints related to them?\n",
      "‘Sufism’ is a mystical branch of Islam, which originated in the 8th century A.D., dedicated\n",
      "to the elimination of the self and to union with God. ‘ Sufism’ is a term used to refer to\n",
      "mystical religious ideas in Islam. It had evolved into a well\n",
      "developed movement by the 11th century A.D. The Sufis were Muslim saints who came\n",
      "originally from Persian and Arabian countries. They stress on the importance of\n",
      "traversing the path of the Sufi pir enabling one to establish a direct communion with the\n",
      "divine. The Sufis derived their name from garments of coarse wool known as Suf which\n",
      "they wore as a badge of poverty as a Faqir. The Sufis did not form a single organized\n",
      "sect, nor did they have any uniform code of religious doctrines. The variety in their ideas\n",
      "and practices was due to the intermixture of Quranic, Christian, Neo-Platonic,\n",
      "Zoroastrian, Buddhist and Hindu elements. Vedanta contributed to the development to\n",
      "their ideas, and some practices of the yoga- such as pranayama- were an integral part\n",
      "of their spiritual discipline. Sufism has rightly been compared to a ‘stream which gathers\n",
      "volume by joining of tributaries from many lands.\n",
      "Among the early known Sufis were Rabia al- Adawiya, Al-Junaid and Bayazid\n",
      "Bastami. Fundamental to Sufism is God, Man and the relation between them that is\n",
      "Love. They believed that from man emerged the theories of ruh (soul), qurbat (divine\n",
      "proximity) and hulul (infusion of the divine spirit) and that from relation between God\n",
      "and Man ideas such as Ishq (divine love) and Fana (self-annihilation) come into being.\n",
      "The Sufis were regarded as people who kept their heart pure; they sought to\n",
      "communicate with God though their ascetic practices and doctrine of divine love and\n",
      "union with God. The murid (disciple) passes through maqamat (various stages) in this\n",
      "process of experiencing communication with the divine.\n",
      "The early Sufis traced their ideas to some Quranic verses and Traditions of the\n",
      "Prophet, to which they gave a mystic or esoteric rather than a literal interpretation.\n",
      "Herein lay basis of their fundamental difference with the orthodox ulama as also with the\n",
      "Muslim rationalists. They claimed that their interpretation represented the true spirit of\n",
      "Islam although these transcended all outward forms of religion. They lived ascetic lives.\n",
      "After many years of travel they settled down in Khanqahs where their blessing, advice\n",
      "and free food were available for the common people. The Khanqah (the hospice) was\n",
      "the centre of activities of the various Sufis orders. The Khanqah was led by shaikh, pir\n",
      "or murshid (teacher) who lived with his murids (disiples). In time the Khanqahs emerged\n",
      "as important\n",
      "centres of learning and preaching. By the 12th century A.D., the Sufis were\n",
      "organized in silsilahs (orders). The word silsila meant chain and it represented signifying\n",
      "an unbreakable chain between the pir and the murid. With the death of the pir his tomb\n",
      "or shrine the dargah became a centre for his disciples and followers.\n",
      "In the 10th century, Sufism spread across important regions of the Islamic\n",
      "empire. Iran, Khurasan, Transoxiana, Egypt, Syria and Baghdad were important Sufi\n",
      "centres. Al-Ghazali, (1059-1111 A.D.) is among the most venerated of Sufis. He\n",
      "reconciled Islamic mysticism with Islamic orthodoxy, providing Sufi mysticism a secure\n",
      "place in Islam. He stressed on the need for the disciple to follow the guidance of the\n",
      "spiritual master. He also emphasized on the supreme authority of the holy Prophet and\n",
      "the need to obey laws in both letter and spirit.\n",
      "The Sufi movement in India commenced in the 11th century A.D. ‘Al Hujwiri’, who\n",
      "established himself in north India was buried in Lahore and regarded as the oldest Sufi\n",
      "in the sub-continent. Among the important Sufi Orders in the history of medieval India\n",
      "were those of the ‘Chishtitiya’, ‘Suhrawardiya’, ‘Qadiriya’ and ‘Naqshbandiya’. ‘Chishti’\n",
      "and ‘Suhrawardi’ silsilahs were popular during the Sultanate period. The Suhrawardis\n",
      "were active in Punjab and Sindh while the Chishti’s were active in Delhi, Rajasthan and\n",
      "parts of the western Gangetic plains. By the end of the Sultanate period they had\n",
      "spread to the eastern regions of the Gangetic plain (Bihar and Bengal) and into the\n",
      "Deccan. During the medieval period the Sufis played an important role in interpreting\n",
      "and elaborating on Islamic theological concepts like Wahdat ul Wujud (unity of being)\n",
      "and also encourage the development of practices like Ziyarat (the practice of visiting\n",
      "tombs).\n",
      "STAGES OF SPIRITUAL JOURNEY IN SUFISM:-\n",
      "Sufism prescribes the stages of the spiritual journey of a soul. The seeker after\n",
      "God is a salik (traveler); progress in spiritual life is suluk (‘travel’ or ‘journey’). Along this\n",
      "journey the salik is guided by a murshid or pir (‘guide’ or ‘elder’) who has already\n",
      "reached the goal by completing the journey and become qualified to lead a seeker who\n",
      "is his murid (aspirant) to the attainment of ma’rifat (‘knowledge’ of God). While\n",
      "proceeding along the course of al-Tariqat (path) the salik follows the practices which are\n",
      "prescribed by the murshid according to the progress made by the seeker. Broadly\n",
      "speaking there are four stages (maqamat), each leading to the next as below:\n",
      "1. Nasut - First Stage: It is the animal nature functioning through five senses, i.e.,\n",
      "eating, seeing, hearing, etc. when the salik brings the senses to the limit of bare\n",
      "necessity and transcends animal nature by purification and asceticism, he\n",
      "reaches the second stage.\n",
      "2. Malakut- Second Stage: It is the ‘region of angels’. The salik conquers his pride\n",
      "through humble prayers to God and transcends this stage.\n",
      "3. Jabarut- Third Stage: It is the ‘region of soul’. The salik’s duties are love,\n",
      "earnestness, joy, seeking, ecstasy, insensibility. When he transcends all these by\n",
      "forgetting self altogether he reaches the fourth stage.\n",
      "4. Lahut- Fourth Stage: It is the stage where ‘words fail’. Divine Light is ‘poured\n",
      "forth so profusely that it absorbs all individual existences in the eyes of the\n",
      "pilgrim’. Here ‘a creature does not become God, nor does it cease to exist.’ The\n",
      "experience of this ‘lofty state’ differs in the case of different pilgrims: some attain\n",
      "to it only for an hour a week, some for an hour a day, some for two hours a day,\n",
      "and some remain absorbed for the greater portion of their time.\n",
      "FEATURES OF SUFI MOVEMENT:-\n",
      "The Sufi movement as it emerged in India had the following features:\n",
      "A. The Sufis were organized in a number of different silsilahs (Orders).\n",
      "B. Most of these orders were led by some prominent Sufi saint or pir. It is named\n",
      "after them and was followed by his disciples.\n",
      "C. The Sufis believed that for union with God one needs a spiritual guru or pir.\n",
      "D. The Sufi pirs lived in Khanqahs with their disciples.The Khanqah (the hospice)\n",
      "was the centre of Sufi activities.\n",
      "E. The Khanqahs emerged as important centres of learning which were different\n",
      "from madrasas the centre of theology.\n",
      "F. Many Sufis enjoyed the musical congregation or sama in their Khanqahs. A\n",
      "musical form called the qawwali developed during this period.\n",
      "G. The ziyarat or pilgrimage to the tombs of the Sufi saints soon emerged as an\n",
      "important form of ritual pilgrimage.\n",
      "H. Most of the Sufis believed in the performance of miracles. Almost all pirs were\n",
      "associated with the miracles performed by them.\n",
      "I. The different Sufi orders had diverse approached about the matters of polity and\n",
      "state.\n",
      "IMPORTANT SUFI ORDERS OR SILSILAHS:-\n",
      "There are four different types of Sufi orders or Silsilahs which are as under:\n",
      "1. ‘THE CHISHTI SILSILAH’:\n",
      "The Chishti Order was established in India by Muinuddin Chishti. He seems to have\n",
      "moved to India after the invasion of Muizzuddin Muhammad Ghori and subsequently\n",
      "to Ajmer in 1206 A.D. The fame of Khwaja Muinuddin grew after his death in 1235\n",
      "A.D. his grave was visited by Muhammad Tughlaq after which the mosque and\n",
      "dome were erected by Mahmud Khalji of Malwa in the 15th century A.D. The\n",
      "patronage of this dargah peaked after the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar.\n",
      "The Chishtis believed in:\n",
      "I. Love as the bond between God and individual\n",
      "soul.\n",
      "II. The tolerance between people of different faiths.\n",
      "III. Acceptance of disciples irrespective of their religious beliefs.\n",
      "Attitude of benevolence to all.\n",
      "IV. Association with Hindu and Jain yogis.\n",
      "V. Use of simple language.\n",
      "The Chishti presence in Delhi was established by Qutbuudin Bakhtiyar Kaki who settled\n",
      "in Delhi from his homeland in Transoxiana in 1221 A.D. This was the time of the Mongol\n",
      "invasions when there was a steady flow of people from central Asia fleeing from the\n",
      "Mongols. His presence in Delhi was a threat to the Suhrawardis who sought to force\n",
      "him to leave by leveling charges against him. The Sultan of Delhi, Itutmish, dismissed\n",
      "these attempts eventually forcing the Suhrawardis to relent. The Chishti pirs laid\n",
      "emphasis on the simplicity of life, poverty, humility and selfless devotion to God. The\n",
      "renunciation of worldly possessions was regarded by them as necessary for the control\n",
      "of the senses that was necessary to maintain a spiritual life. Khwaja Muinuddin Chishti\n",
      "argued that highest form of devotion to God was to redress the misery of those in\n",
      "distress, fulfilling the need of the helpless and to feed the hungry. They refused to\n",
      "accept any grant for their maintenance from the Sultans.\n",
      "The other important Chishti Baba Fariduddin Ganj-i-Shakar, established himself\n",
      "at Hansi (in Haryana) on the route between Multan and Lahore. Nizamuddin Auliya was\n",
      "the best known Chishti saint of the Sultanate period. He\n",
      "lived in the 14th century A.D., during a period of political change and turmoil.\n",
      "During his lifetime he was witness to the establishment of the Khalji rule after the death\n",
      "of Balban and subsequently the establishment of the Tughlaq’s. There are numerous\n",
      "stories of his confrontations with the Sultans of Delhi. The Khwaja is said to have\n",
      "maintained a strict policy of not involving himself with the various groups and factions of\n",
      "the Sultan’s court in Delhi earning him the respect of many. Nasiruddin Chirag Delhi\n",
      "was another of the Chishti saints of Delhi. He played an active role in the political affairs\n",
      "of the period. All these enabled Sufis to maintain a loyal and dedicated following.\n",
      "In the 13th century A.D. the Chishti Order was established in the Deccan by\n",
      "Shaikh Burhanuddin Gharib. Between the 14th and 16th centuries many Chishti\n",
      "Sufis migrated to Gulbarga. This was accompanied with a change where some of the\n",
      "Chishtis began accepting grants and patronage from the ruling establishment.\n",
      "Muhammad Banda Nawaj is among the famous pirs in the region. The Deccan city of\n",
      "Bijapur emerged as an important centre of Sufi activity.\n",
      "2. ‘THE SUHRAWARDI SILSILAH’:-\n",
      "This Silsilah was founded by Shihabuddin Suhrawardi in Baghdad. It was\n",
      "established in India by Bahauddin Zakariya. He founded the Suhrawardi Order,\n",
      "based in Multan, which was under the control of Qubacha. He was critical of\n",
      "Qubacha and openly favored Iltutmish over his rival. His ways were different from\n",
      "that of the Chishtis. The Suhrawardis, unlike the Chishtis, accepted, maintenance\n",
      "grants from the Sultans. They believed that a Sufi should possess the three\n",
      "attributes of property, knowledge and hal or mystical enlightenment. Suhrawardi\n",
      "saints argued that this was necessary to ensure that they served the poor better. He\n",
      "stressed on the observance or external forms of religious belief and advocated a\n",
      "combination of ilm (scholarship) with mysticism. Practices like bowing before the\n",
      "Sheikh, presenting water to visitors and tonsuring the head at the time of initiation\n",
      "into the Order that the Chishtis had adopted were rejected. After his death the\n",
      "silsilah continued to play an important role in Punjab and Sindh.\n",
      "3. ‘THE NAQSHBANDI SILSILAH’:-\n",
      "In India this order was established by Khwaja Bahauddin Naqshbandi. From\n",
      "beginning the mystics of this Order stressed on the observance of the shariat and\n",
      "denounced all innovations or biddat. Sheikh Baqi Billah the successor to Khwaja\n",
      "Bahauddin Naqshbandi settled near Delhi, and his successor Shaikh Ahmad Sirhindi\n",
      "attempted to purge Islam from all liberal and what he believed were ‘un-Islamic’\n",
      "practices. He opposed the listening of sama (religious music) and the practice of\n",
      "pilgrimage to the tombs of saints. He criticized the new status accorded by Akbar to\n",
      "many non-Muslims, the withdrawal of the Jizyah and the ban on cow slaughter. He\n",
      "believed that he was the mujaddid (renewer) of the first millennium Islam. He\n",
      "maintained that the relationship between man and God was that between the salve\n",
      "and the master and not the relation of a lover and beloved. He emphasized the\n",
      "individual’s unique relation of faith and responsibility to God as creator. He tried to\n",
      "harmonize the doctrines of mysticism and the teachings of orthodox Islam.\n",
      "4. ‘THE QADRI SILSILAH:-\n",
      "The Quadiriyya silsilah was popular in Punjab. Sheikh Abdul Qadir and his sons were\n",
      "supporters of the Mughals under Akbar. The pirs of the Order supported the concept\n",
      "of Wahdat al Wajud . Among the famous Sufis of this Order was Mian Mir who had\n",
      "enrolled the Mughal princess Jahanara and her brother Dara as disciples. The\n",
      "influence of the Sheikh’s teachings is evident in the works of the prince. Shah\n",
      "Badakhshani another pir of this silsilah while dismissing orthodox elements, declared\n",
      "that, the infidel who had perceived reality and recognized it was a believer and that a\n",
      "believer who did not recognize reality was an infidel.\n",
      "During medieval period there was constant tension between the liberal and\n",
      "orthodox views in Islam. The Sufis featured on both sides, while there were those like\n",
      "the Chishtis who held a liberal view and argued in favor of assimilation of local\n",
      "traditions there were others like Sheikh Abdul Haqq of the Qadiriyya silsilah who held\n",
      "the view that the purity of Islam was being diluted. This orthodox view was\n",
      "represented by the ulema that argued from the perspective of being upholders of the\n",
      "shariat. The liberal opinion found its voice among many Sufis who argued the narrow\n",
      "definition of Islamic laws by the ulema.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The Sufi movement has played a wonderful part as a binding thread which has\n",
      "collected the pearls of wisdom for the whole human race and has discarded the\n",
      "concept of steadfast and rigid philosophies emanating from various sects and religions.\n",
      "It has come as a whiff of fresh air to the society which has its roots in rationalism,\n",
      "truthful and clear thought processes without fake and misleading perceptions. It talks\n",
      "about a pure and humble heart which is a pre- requisite to take a spiritual flight. It also\n",
      "advocated oneness of God who is the beloved of every human soul.\n",

      "Lecture No.13\n",
      "Lecture title – Cultural Contributions of Mughal Rulers\n",
      "Script\n",
      "Hello students, today we are going to talk about the Cultural contributions of Mughal rulers\n",
      "with the aim to give a brief outline of the various contributions of the Mughals in India which\n",
      "would help us in understanding the cultural, political, social and economic conditions of that\n",
      "time.\n",
      "Muslim rule in India is always depicted in the darkest possible colors and Muslim rulers are\n",
      "almost invariably described as tyrants and blood-thirsty monsters, whose unrestrained\n",
      "autocracy found its full expression in fanaticism in the forcible propagation of Islam, in the\n",
      "oppression of the Hindus, in the destruction of their temples and in the suppression of their\n",
      "genius.\n",
      "But, there is enough in the existing literature on Indo-Islamic history to show that the Muslim\n",
      "kings of India were great conquerors, endowed with uncommon military genius, but there is\n",
      "very little in it to convey the least idea that they were also gifted with a keen zest for social life\n",
      "and gentle arts and that their victories in the arts of peace were no less remarkable than their\n",
      "achievements in the science of war.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "The present is an endeavor to reveal the cultural aspects of their rule, and from the ensuing\n",
      "account it will be evident that they made mighty contributions to almost every department of\n",
      "Indian life and thought- so mighty in fact that during the millennium of their rule in India they\n",
      "worked a complete revolution in the life and thought of her people.\n",
      "Subject matter:\n",
      "The political or territorial expansion of the Commonwealth of Islam went apace and the\n",
      "standards of Islam, bearing the emblem of crescent, were carried far and wide by the\n",
      "Musalmans under the ennobling influence of their religion. With the conquest of Persia and\n",
      "the transfer of the seat of government to Baghdad, Persian ideas and ideals began to flow\n",
      "fast into the rank and file of the followers of Islam, changing their spiritual outlook into one\n",
      "material. Coming into close contact with the Persians, the Denizens of the Desert, as the\n",
      "Arabs are significantly called, took an extraordinary fancy to the ideas of the former. The\n",
      "conquerors were literally conquered by the culture of the conquered people. They took such a\n",
      "fancy to the culture of the Persians that in their eager fascination for it they did not even tried\n",
      "to pick and choose from Persian ideas but assimilated them wholesale in almost every\n",
      "department of administration and in every aspect of their social life. From Baghdad these\n",
      "ideas of kingship travelled into Ghaznin, as also to other parts of the world, and thence made\n",
      "their way into India with the march of Musalmans into that country. India, an ancient country\n",
      "like Persia, offered a most favourable field for the cultivation of such ideas. Here the\n",
      "submissiveness of the people and the ancient traditions of the country furnished a most\n",
      "congenial atmosphere for the establishment of absolute monarchy.\n",
      "The Muslim kings thus are credited for a number of important influences in the state,\n",
      "administrative system, social life, religion, education, architecture, gardening, painting, poetry\n",
      "and music.\n",
      "The State , Administrative System and Social Life\n",
      "(i) The State: The familiar custom of holding what are now called Darbars (courts) has been\n",
      "popular in Persia from times immemorial. In India it became a permanent institution during the\n",
      "first fifty years of the Muslim period. The Sultans of Delhi held Darbars on a number of public\n",
      "occasions, such as the coronation of a monarch, the commemoration of a victory or an\n",
      "important event, the consummation of the marriage of a royal prince or princess, the\n",
      "celebration of the birth of a baby or the anniversary of a member of the royal family. There\n",
      "were other Darbars popularly known as Jashns, which were held to celebrate certain social\n",
      "and religious festivals and were noted for pomp and pageantry, culminating in a lavish\n",
      "distribution of robes of honour and rewards.\n",
      "(ii) Administrative System: The Empire was divided into a number of provinces, each of\n",
      "which was usually known by the name of the country or its capital. A province was, therefore,\n",
      "the biggest administrative division. It was placed in charge of a trusted officer who acted as\n",
      "the viceroy of the king in it. Each viceroy employed a large number of subordinate officials for\n",
      "the effective administration of his province. Further talking about law and justice, there were\n",
      "no such courts of law and justice as exist in these days. The king was the fountain of justice\n",
      "and his was the highest court of appeal. The Qazis settled the cases among the Musalmans\n",
      "in accordance with the Shariyat, and civil disputes relating to inheritance, succession, etc.,\n",
      "among the Hindus were allowed to be decided by Hindu judges or Panchayats (juries). The\n",
      "Muslim kings were noted for their impartiality in judicial matters.\n",
      "The Muslim kings maintained a well-organized police force in order to enforce law and order\n",
      "and to facilitate impartial dissemination of justice. The Kotwal, or the policeman-in-chief, was\n",
      "the custodian of public peace and security. Further on the Government Service was not the\n",
      "monopoly of the ruling race. It was open to all Hindus and Muslims who possessed the\n",
      "required qualifications. Muslim kings also showed a remarkable interest in the upkeep and\n",
      "development of means of communication and transport and the result was a wide-spread\n",
      "network of the roads and highways in the Muslim Empire.\n",
      "(iii) Social life: Many Muslim kings were sincerely interested in the social as well as moral\n",
      "well-being of their subjects, irrespective of the sects to which they belonged or the creeds\n",
      "they professed. They forbade drinking and gambling and tried their best to suppress\n",

      "the foundations of Indian society, were systematically discouraged and forbidden and widow-\n",

      "Religious Influences, Education and Architecture\n",
      "4) Religious Influences: Toleration in true sense was the sheet-anchor of Muslim Rule in\n",
      "India and the Muslim Kings never interfered with the religion of their non-Muslim subjects.\n",
      "They enjoined not only liberty of thought and freedom of worship, but also admitted them to all\n",
      "powers and privileges which they themselves enjoyed. The place that woman occupies and\n",
      "the privilege she enjoys in Muslim society in accordance with the commands of the Quran are\n",
      "in no way inferior to those of man. Man and woman are equally indispensable for each other.\n",
      "The Pardah system was also introduced in this country by the Musalmans. It was a sin for\n",
      "women to appear in public and hence Purdah was a religious duty.\n",
      "5) Education : No Medieval Government had a regular department of Public instruction, but\n",
      "Muslim India of the Middle Ages could justly boast of possessing one which looked after\n",
      "religious as well as educational institutions. Hardly was there a Muslim prince of importance\n",
      "whose name is not associated with the opening and endowing of a school or a college in his\n",
      "kingdom. Muslim kings, as a rule, took a living interest in the education of their subjects.\n",
      "Education made mighty strides during the Muslim Period, so much so in fact that Muslim\n",
      "universities of Mediaeval India were thronged by thousands of students and professors had\n",
      "often hundreds of hearers.\n",
      "Apart from houses, where individual instructors imparting education received remuneration\n",
      "from their pupils in the form of personal service the principal types of educational institutions\n",
      "were universities, Madrasas and Maktabs. While there were universities in capital cities and\n",
      "Maktabs and Madrasas in smaller towns, no village was without a mosque and no mosque\n",
      "was without a Maktab and a modest library. Mosques were not restricted to Ibadat or divine\n",
      "worship alone, but were also used as lecture-halls and places of instruction. Further on\n",
      "technical education was given in Karkhanas or workshops through the system of\n",
      "apprenticeship.\n",
      "The boys who did not attend a Maktab or a Madrasa were sent to these workshops for\n",
      "receiving necessary training in arts and crafts. Arabic, the language of the Quran, was a\n",
      "compulsory subject in almost all schools and colleges and Persian, the language of the Court,\n",
      "was the medium of instruction.\n",
      "Before the advent of Islam in India education was the monopoly of the Brahmans who, for\n",
      "reasons of their own, refused to impart it to the masses. But under the Muslim rulers of India,\n",
      "whose religion recognized no barriers of rank or race in the acquisition of knowledge, it\n",
      "therefore became the birth-right of every citizen, Muslim as well as Hindu. One of the great\n",
      "results of this mutually reciprocal understanding and intercourse of Hindus and Muslims,\n",
      "facilitated by the liberal educational policy of Muslim Kings, was the creation of a new\n",
      "language, Urdu the off-spring of Persian and Hindi, which in course of time superseded its\n",
      "parents and became the lingua franca of Northern India.\n",
      "There existed separate Maktabs for the education of girls, but usually they received their\n",
      "education in the same schools where the boys did, of course, up to the primary standard\n",
      "when sexual consciousness had not yet awakened, and after that they were segregated from\n",
      "them and given their education either privately or in the schools specially provided for them.\n",
      "A short reference may also be made to the libraries which sprang up in India as a beneficial\n",
      "result of the love of learning of most of its Muslim rulers and became a valuable asset to the\n",
      "sacred cause of education. Muslim kings and other men of means used to collect rich stores\n",
      "of literature for their own use and build up big libraries which figured prominently among their\n",
      "proud possessions. There were libraries which were thrown open to and availed of by the\n",
      "public in general. In passing, we may also point out that it was the Musalmans who brought\n",
      "paper into India about the tenth century A.C. and popularized its use there.\n",
      "(vi) Architecture: The medieval period saw great developments in the field of architecture.\n",
      "With the coming of Muslims to India, many new features came to be introduced in buildings.\n",
      "There was gradually a harmonious blending between the Hindu and Muslim architectural\n",
      "styles and this new style of architecture is known as Indo-Islamic. The fundamental Islamic\n",
      "dogma is the unity of God or Allah and it is the requirement for prayer that constitute the prime\n",
      "progenitor of architecture in Islam. The most important buildings in Islam are religious in\n",
      "function like the mosques and tombs or secular like the palaces and halls. Indo-Islamic style\n",
      "is usually divided into three phases: the Delhi Sultanate or Pashtun style, the Provincial, and\n",
      "the Mughal phase.\n",
      "The mode, theme or motifs or ornamentation employed in Islamic buildings also made a\n",
      "departure from the earlier vogues. The Hindu style or ornamentation is largely naturalistic\n",
      "showing human and animal forms and the luxuriant vegetation life. As among the Muslims the\n",
      "representation of living beings was taboo by way of decoration or ornamentation, they\n",
      "introduced geometrical and arabesque patterns, ornamental writing and formal representation\n",
      "of plant and floral life. In short the contribution of the Muslims to Indo-Muslim architecture is\n",
      "profound and no less interesting. Among the architectural features introduced by them\n",
      "mention may be made of arches, domes, minars and minarets, the pendentive, squinch arch,\n",
      "half domed double portals, kiosks or chhatris and the use of concrete as a factor of\n",
      "construction. They also introduced gilding and painting in varied colors and designs. Muslim\n",
      "decorative elements are usually of the nature of embroidery. Thus the Indo-Islamic\n",
      "architecture is entirely different in character from Muslim architecture in other countries,\n",
      "incorporating the best of both Hindu and, Muslim styles.\n",
      "Gardens , Painting , Poetry , Music and Dance\n",
      "(vii) Gardens: The garden design was another secular art much cultivated by Mughals. The\n",
      "bagh or gardens of the Mughals are world famous. Some of these formal gardens can still be\n",
      "seen in Kashmir. The idea underlying their gardens was in fact the creation of an Iram\n",
      "(paradise) and the realization of that object on earth. With high-walled enclosures, redolent\n",
      "with fragrant flowers, gaily plumaged birds, a captured stream running through the garden in\n",
      "rhythmic harmony, arching trees sheltering the spring flowers, and a tank in the middle\n",
      "reflects the flower-beds around. The legendary paradise was fully attained and nothing\n",
      "beautiful that could be conceived by human mind seems to have been left wanting. Symmetry\n",
      "was the key-note of the Mughal art of gardening and the guiding principle of Mughal\n",
      "gardeners. Balance, harmony and precision were evident everywhere in the Mughal gardens.\n",
      "8) Painting: The art of painting did not receive the attention and encouragement which other\n",
      "arts did at the hands of the early Muslim kings of India. This was mainly because it was\n",
      "tabooed in the early days of Islam on account of its close association with idolatry. It was only\n",
      "occasionally that the Muslim kings and nobles broke away from the general convention and\n",
      "practiced this art.\n",
      "The Mugahl School of painting was therefore the most significant contribution of Akbar. He\n",
      "established a State atelier where about a hundred artists, mostly Hindu, worked under the\n",
      "guidance of the two Persian masters brought to India by Humayun. Early in Akbar s reign the\n",
      "Portuguese had established trading-posts in India. As gifts for the emperor they brought\n",
      "illustrated Bibles and religious pictures which so fascinated Akbar that he immediately\n",
      "instructed his own painters to emulate their qualities. Thus European realism was added to\n",
      "the embryonic Mughal style; a number of miniatures even depict Christian subjects.\n",
      "Closely connected with the art of painting is the art of illuminating books, which received a\n",
      "great stimulus in India under the influence of Islam. Muslims have always been very fond of\n",
      "illuminating manuscripts of the Quran and other religious and classic literature with beautiful\n",
      "gold borders on every page and of having their bindings adorned with gold. While we are\n",
      "speaking about books, we may appropriately make a short reference to calligraphy. The art of\n",
      "writing a beautiful hand had been very widely cultivated by Musalmans ever since their advent\n",
      "in India. The state encouraged this art and employed a large number of scribes for copying\n",
      "books etc.\n",
      "9) Poetry: Poetry has been a most popular subject among the Muslims from very early days.\n",
      "Their love of beauty found full scope and a most suitable expression in this art. Some\n",
      "practiced it as a profession, while others resorted to it as a relaxation from other pursuits.\n",
      "Poetry, like painting and other fine arts, reached the pinnacle of its glory under the patronage\n",
      "of the Great Mughals, almost all of whom were poet of distinction, vitally interested in the\n",
      "promotion of poetry. Poetry as well as prose, both of which were liberally encouraged by\n",
      "Muslim Kings and other well-to-do lovers of learning, acted, as it were, a conduit-pipe through\n",
      "which ideals of Islam and Islamic culture were diffused in India among non-Muslims.\n",
      "10)Music: The contact of Islam with Iran, where music was most popular, and the influence of\n",
      "Sufis (Muslim mystics), who believed in the efficacy of music as a means of elevating the soul\n",
      "and as an aid to spiritual progress, brought about a great change in the attitude of Musalmans\n",
      "toward this art and went a long way in wiping off the stigma attached to it. The position was\n",
      "further simplified when Musalmans settled down in India and found music occupying a high\n",
      "place in the scheme of Hindu social and religious life. The result was that though divine\n",
      "service in mosques continued to be performed on orthodox lines, without extraneous aids of\n",
      "music, either vocal or instrumental, the art became so popular that musicians began to loom\n",
      "large on almost all festive occasions. The Sufis' fondness for music brought into vogue and\n",
      "practice of holding semi-religious congregations, where songs of divine love called Qawwalis\n",
      "were sung by professional singers called Qawwals.\n",
      "11)Dancing: Dancing was equally popular and pursued with remarkable zeal. It had\n",
      "developed its own technique. It was a necessary corollary to music, so much so that it was\n",
      "difficult to imagine a music party unaccompanied by dancing. Dancers had their own peculiar\n",
      "dresses, suiting their arts. There were regular dancing girls who could be engaged for music\n",
      "parties. The Devadasis are too well known to call for a special notice.\n",
      "Music, in short, was most popular in Muslim India, more than we are led to believe. One\n",
      "reason for its popularity may be found in the fact that a vast majority of Indian Muslims were\n",
      "originally Hindus or off-spring of Hindus, who were too fond of it to give it up after embracing\n",
      "Islam, with the result that the art imperceptibly permeated Muslim ranks and became widely\n",
      "popular.\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Therefore to conclude we can say that political topics such as the State and the system of\n",
      "administration; social subjects such as slavery, status of woman, Pardah system, games and\n",
      "recreations, feasts and festivals, etc.; social legislation, aiming at the suppression of Sati and\n",
      "infanticide among the Hindus and of immorality, gambling and drinking among the people in\n",
      "general; some of the teachings of Islam and their influence on Hindu religious thought and\n",
      "practice; and some economic features such as encouragement of famine relief, construction\n",
      "of canals and well for purposes of irrigation, etc. are some other subjects of interest and\n",
      "importance which bring out the culture of Indian Muslim kings and their contributions to the\n",
      "cultural heritage of India. The achievements of Muslim kings in various departments of life\n",
      "may not be equal to those of their preceptors of Arabia, but they were certainly, superior to\n",
      "those of the contemporary crowned heads of other countries. The fact that they were able to\n",
      "establish their rule in a country so rich in resources and inhabited by such warlike races as\n",
      "the Rajputs and govern it with remarkable success for so many centuries with the co-\n",
      "operation and support, without offending the susceptibilities or provoking any reaction of the\n",
      "people over whom they ruled is a glowing tribute to the refined side of their file and a good\n",
      "testimony to the national character of their government. It will be only when the annals of their\n",
      "history are stripped of the passion and prejudice of generations and purged of the communal\n",
      "hatred they have been stored with that their noble efforts at establishing peace and a popular\n",
      "government, based on the acquiescent good-will of the people of all classes and creeds, in a\n",
      "disturbed and caste-ridden country, will be appreciated and their real places in history\n",
      "determined.\n",
      "So with this we come to the end of this lecture and I hope by this time you might have got a\n",
      "brief but clear picture about the cultural contributions of the Mughal rulers. Thank you.\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "Kala or Art connotes making or doing, essentially indicating a human activity. Doing or\n",
      "making pre‐ supposes a doer or maker with one or more objects. ‘Kalakar’ ‘kal’ is\n",
      "indicative of time and also machine and ‘ kar’ means doing work with hands. There is an\n",
      "urge that arises in every man and animal. This urge is to create and communicate through\n",
      "the creation. But there is a stark difference between the human and animal in their\n",
      "communication or expression. A bee can identify nectar and might communicate it to the\n",
      "other fellow bees for example but they cannot tell the direction by left or right turns.\n",
      "Human emotions are replete with sentiments of pathos, joy, sympathy, etc. Man relates\n",
      "to his surroundings and the society in which he is brought up. The art activity is\n",
      "dependent upon the faculties of the mind not in isolation from the surrounding\n",
      "environment. The five sense organs in the body: The eyes, the nose, the mouth, the ears\n",
      "and the skin help man to observe with keen perception. The five elements of nature help\n",
      "the artist to enhance the moments of realization or perception. This encourages him to\n",
      "understand not alone himself but things around him and adjust to the world accordingly.\n",
      "At the outset it would be essential to differentiate between the folk artist and the\n",
      "craftsman. They were understood as one in traditional manner. The folk artist is generally\n",
      "a craftsman and his activity is mainly the production of utility objects. Folk artist has\n",
      "cumulative originality he might treat his subject often with innovation. A noted Art Historian\n",
      "Kramrisch Stella has described two kinds of Folk arts: ‘time bound and the timeless.’ The\n",
      "later are known to be repetitive and ritualistic. The Folk artists have a lively imagination\n",
      "and keep their forms simple and bold. Heroes and Heroines are more emphasized. The\n",
      "selection of colors is essentially bright. Shading too is eliminated and fat flling of colors is\n",
      "done. There is seen an exaggeration of gesture and expression. Repetitive lines, dots,\n",
      "form and colors is seen which emerges from the play of the sub‐conscious mind and adds\n",
      "rhythm to the composed work. The folk artist takes no formal training but works through\n",
      "instinct. For example an artist might use blue color and a folk artist might use blue color\n",
      "but for an artist to use blue color there is no taboo on using the blue color. Jaya\n",
      "Appaswamy a noted Art Historian feels that ‘The craftsman can make similar things over\n",
      "and over though he can also be innovative now and then.’\n",
      "Literary Texts:\n",
      "The Vishnudharmottaram states the fundamentals on Indian Art that need to be\n",
      "highlighted and states clearly that ‘to be able to appreciate painting one must know the\n",
      "principles of nritta dance for the understanding of the later one must know the art of\n",
      "atodya acting, to appreciate that one must know the art of gita song and so on. The\n",
      "process in painting is more mental than physical. The first known woman artist in Ancient\n",
      "Indian art is understood as Chitralekha. Usha she dreams, she tells chitralekha of how\n",
      "she dreams of Anirudha and the birth of Anirudha, the princess dreams of Prince\n",
      "Anirudha as a handsome young man. In her description of what she had seen in her\n",
      "dream the birth of Anirudha, the Prince takes place with the mental concentration of\n",
      "Chitralekha appears in front of the canvas. The birth of Anirudha in dream. The artist\n",
      "could interpret the dream through her forms and infuse the right content into the image.\n",
      "Thus came about the painting from not alone imagination but also emotional and\n",
      "intellectual thought process.\n",
      "The creative imagination occupies an important role where the description at one end is\n",
      "reciprocated by rendering words into lines, colors and form on the other. Poet Kalidasa’s\n",
      "in many of his kavyas on how an artist would conceive a painting. Shakuntala was created\n",
      "by the mental rupachehaya of Brahma who first drew her and subsequently endowed her\n",
      "with life. This art work is the first touch of creativity. A complete replica appears on the\n",
      "canvas. This infusion of life is what an artist does on the canvas. Artist’s creative endeavor\n",
      "and critic’s appreciation is shown by Kalidasa where Dushyanta is both a painter and a\n",
      "critic. He is known to paint her portrait from the reserves of his memory. The painting\n",
      "ought to have a living spark about it which is the very secret of the artistic process. To\n",
      "understand the word living spark a few examples are: At another instance the elephants\n",
      "are seen bathing in a lotus pond as depicted as murals, a lion attacks it with the claws\n",
      "taking him as real. A parrot is shown talking to the images of men and women on the wall\n",
      "taking them as real, etc. It is so realistic, this parrot that appears to be talking to the\n",
      "images. As if he is in communication with the images. In Meghaduta in a separation of one\n",
      "year the mental portrait she draws of her Lord is created by her imagination. The Yaksini\n",
      "in Meghaduta of Kalidasa was supposed to be painting a mental portrait of her Lord and\n",
      "the role of heart, hand and mind. The same idea is manifested in Malavikagnimitram when\n",
      "looking at the Nayika in life the king felt that she looked even more charming than her\n",
      "image. In Kamasutra through the Shadanga theory or six limbs of Indian art, Rupa Bheda,\n",
      "Pramana, Lavanya Yojanam, Bhava and the expression through Varnika Bhanga how the\n",
      "artist has learnt yet unlearnt what he has learnt and he works on the canvas, highlights the\n",
      "rendering of a painting and Manasollasa by Somesvara defnes it as an image in painting\n",
      "which follows the realism of a pratibimba (refection) in the mirror. The image looking into\n",
      "the mirror, the Nayika when she looks into the mirror and the projection of the artist\n",
      "looking into the mirror is what is seen as the pratibimbha. The self same image when an\n",
      "artist feels while creating art and\n",
      "Sthaviravali charita too agrees to adarsa‐pratibimbha.\n",
      "What is to be understood here is that painting is the way artist perceives the subject\n",
      "through his eyes and with his keen perception and contemplation of the\n",
      "subject brings forth a work that has perfectly independent identity. It is not only the eye\n",
      "for an artist which are important but it is his eyes, heart, hand and his complete system\n",
      "that fows with energy in the work of art. It might not be a work of art at that stage but it\n",
      "is the best of his that he is giving. The society plays an important role. It is not learnt art\n",
      "but his creativity. The work needs to give rise to Rasa or a pleasant feeling. Kalidasa in\n",
      "Malavikagnimitram calls Malvika’s eyes as nayanmadhu (honey for eyes) to attract\n",
      "Agnimitra. Eye contact is very special. It could be maddening. Sudraka’s\n",
      "Mrichchhakatika and\n",
      "Bhasa’s Svapnavasavadattam too emphasizes this aspect.\n",
      "Creation is dynamic as it is beset with an urge to express. Communication is an\n",
      "important element in the theory of art, the complexity of this element varies from art to\n",
      "art. In an art like music, communication has no independent status and is dependent\n",
      "upon the artist. If the artist stops singing it leaves an impression on the mind of the\n",
      "audience. In arts like painting and sculpture it takes the form of an object and has an\n",
      "independent existence. Dramatic element in painting was derived by exaggerated\n",
      "postures and the human figure was derived from idealized form. One has to be self-\n",
      "possessed for achieving the same. Meaning should be properly expressed by means of\n",
      "bodily postures. As is understood from the term ‘vapur visesha’ (from\n",
      "Kumarasambhava).Kumarasambhavavis a text which relates to the love of\n",

      "poetry and ordinary language are dependent on the spoken or writen symbols.\n",
      "Removed from the stage Drama too is a form of poetry. Only the stage part (prayoga)\n",
      "transforms Nataka into Natya.\n",
      "Niharranjan Ray, a prolific writer says‐‘The maker creates according to his world‐ view\n",
      "of things, his inner desire (kama) and his understanding of the nature and character of\n",
      "the object or objects.’ He is supposedly the one to discipline and organize things in a\n",
      "way that the produced object is neither solely him, nor the material alone but a third\n",
      "entity. Art activity would encompass the inert, inanimate mater like the words, lines,\n",
      "colors, surfaces, volumes, stone, wood, metal, etc. and animate beings like men and\n",
      "animals. Art activity therefore deals with the question of inter‐ relationship of firstly\n",
      "subject and object and secondly inert, object and form. Subject and object are mutually\n",
      "dependent.\n",
      "The need for man to make art is because of the biological urge to create (Kama).\n",
      "Kama is the germinal seat of all creative activities. When man wishes to communicate\n",
      "his emotions, desires, feelings, passions, visions, dreams, ideas, images, etc to his\n",
      "fellow beings the creative side takes over. His communication is through words and\n",
      "sounds (music, poetry and literature), gestures and movements (dance and drama),\n",
      "lines, colors, surfaces, depths, volumes, tones, touch, etc. (sculpture, painting and\n",
      "architecture) comes to life. The level of satiation should be at the level of the one who\n",
      "creates it and the one who receives it as a spectator. What is being communicated\n",
      "must be meaningful. The communication need not be at the level of the senses but\n",
      "must penetrate deep at the intrinsic level. The mode and manner of communication\n",
      "determines the form and the content of communication.\n",
      "The biological urge for communication is present in both animals and man. Man is\n",
      "differentiated from an animal by his faculties of physical and psychic properties and a\n",
      "conscious mind. Art is a moral activity of a social man and works for the improvement\n",
      "of the human species other than producing species of its kind. Art activity brings about\n",
      "order and discipline to the objects that are chaotic and disorganized. This semblance in\n",
      "day-to-day life adds rhythm and aesthetics in life. This is where the role of balance,\n",
      "harmony, rhythm, proportion, etc. referred to as the Principles of Art. is seen that\n",
      "enriches the human personality.\n",
      "Art does not in any way imitate nature. The artist does represent it in his own style but\n",
      "copying is not what he does. The subject and object undergo a transformation and it is\n",
      "not possible for the artist to imitate nature. The artist has a profound influence of his\n",

      "The Aesthetic Experience\n",
      "The aesthetic experience according to Niharranjan Ray‐‘is the experience of intrinsic\n",
      "perception, through intent concentration (yoga, dhyana) to an object or situation.’ The\n",
      "levels of understanding may vary from person to person. Secondly ‘the active process\n",
      "of intent concentration is dependent upon complete detachment from practical action,\n",
      "complete disinterestedness from any practical ends of life and certain kind of physical\n",
      "distancing. It is known to have the same quality of joy and delight arising of tasting the\n",
      "Brahman or of copulation of the sexes. The experience is assumed to bring about\n",
      "certain psychical and physiological transformation in the perceiver. Rasa experience is\n",
      "the quintessence of aesthetic experience. Bhava is the given state of being. Both are\n",
      "essential to understand the aesthetic experience. Aesthetic experience is an end in\n",
      "itself; it is no means to any further end. The acquiring of knowledge cannot be ruled out\n",
      "and keen intrinsic perception is essential.\n",
      "The gaining of this aesthetic experience evokes the desire in the creative mind to share\n",
      "his experience with others and thus communicate these desires to others as part of the\n",
      "social structure. Aesthetic experience is based primarily on human emotions. It is\n",
      "essentially pleasurable. Mostly free from sensual elements. The aesthetic experience is\n",
      "a state of transcendental joy or a state of self fulfillment or sublimated emotions. It is\n",
      "not possible to conceive a form of beauty without some threads of emotional\n",
      "association. Yet the artistic emotions are distinct from the human emotions and the two\n",
      "cannot be identical under any circumstance. Aesthetic pleasure is kind of psycho‐\n",
      "physical pleasure.\n",
      "Between the Aesthetic experience and the making of the objective phase a few points\n",
      "need to be kept in mind: The sensitivity of the perceiver is more heightened and\n",
      "sharpened than that of others; The personality that is directly dependent upon the social\n",
      "order in which he was brought up; Technical process, his ideas and visions and his\n",
      "creative process; The process of articulation is long when an artist expands and\n",
      "deepens his imagination, evolves his technique and clarifies his aesthetic vision. Once\n",
      "the artist achieves this, his creative imagination, the depth of his personality, his ideas,\n",
      "visions, images, etc. are enhanced with his skill and he objectifies them. The form is the\n",
      "shape that can be abstract, geometrical or at random enclosing some area but ideas,\n",
      "visions, images, symbols, feelings, and emotions go to constitute the content of art.\n",
      "There is nature outside the mind of man. When the mind with sensibility perceives\n",
      "nature, it not only receives impression as in a mirror but transforms according to his\n",
      "temperament. When this aesthetic sensibility becomes creative such creation pre‐\n",
      "supposes value. The end value paramapurusharatha is nothing less than moksha or\n",
      "emancipation, dharma or moral good, artha or wealth and kama or pleasure. Human\n",
      "experience can be divided into three broad categories: sensual, mental and intellectual.\n",
      "In Bhavabhuti’s words ‘I cannot determine whether it is pleasure or pain, whether stupor\n",
      "or sleep whether working of poison or intoxication: at every touch of thing a certain\n",
      "sensation comes upon me which stupefying all my senses, now bewilders my\n",
      "consciousness, now paralyzes it.’ Thus aesthetic experience is defined as a complex\n",
      "experience, pleasant in essence in which the emotional and intellectual elements are\n",
      "blended in subtle harmony.\n",
      "If we look at the animals depicted in the Indus Valley Culture we observe that they not\n",
      "alone appear as symbols but are entities in real life, animated by and effusive of their\n",

      "Today in this particular lecture we aim to encase Mauryan Period in a wider perspective,\n",
      "which would help us to study the history and cultural development during Mauryan rule\n",
      "in India.\n",
      "The Mauryan Period constitutes a distinctive landmark in the history and cultural\n",
      "development of India. This period was marked not only by the blossoming of culture and\n",
      "arts, the growth of the economy and increased contacts with other countries, but also by\n",
      "the formation of a unified state, the first in Indian history, which incorporated a greater\n",
      "part of the Indian subcontinent and some adjacent regions.it is no accident that the lion\n",
      "capital of Sarnath column, bearing the edicts of Mauryan King Ashoka inscribed over\n",
      "two thousand years ago, has become the National emblem of the Republic of India.\n",
      "It was in the Mauryan Period that the basic features of social structure, the Varna and\n",
      "caste system, and major institute of ancient Indian society and state emerged and took\n",
      "shape. A number of religious and philosophical trends developed; including Buddhism,\n",
      "which was gradually transformed from sectarian monastic teaching into one of the\n",
      "world’s three great religions.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "The Mauryan Empire was one of the largest states not only in ancient India but also\n",
      "perhaps in the whole of the ancient Orient. Within its frame work it united a great\n",
      "number of peoples and tribes which differed from one another in ethnological and\n",
      "linguistic respects, which were at different cultural levels subscribed to different creeds,\n",
      "and followed different customs and traditions. So this long historical Mauryan Period is\n",
      "associated with important changes in polity, society and economy and to grasp these\n",
      "changes one need to examine the main trends of development of Mauryan Period.\n",
      "Subject Matter:\n",
      "In the history of India, the Mauryan dynasty is the first historical dynasty; about which\n",
      "definite historical knowledge is available. It was the first time that the rulers of this\n",
      "dynasty gave the country its long needed unity and began to administer India\n",
      "systematically. The founder of this dynasty was Chandragupta Maurya, who probably\n",
      "named his dynasty as Maurya, after the name of his mother, Mura. Chandragupta\n",
      "liberated his country from the foreign rule and laid the foundation of a vast empire. His\n",
      "grandson, Ashoka, by his parental treatment towards his subjects made not only his\n",
      "own name and that of his dynasty immortal, but also left a living example of public\n",
      "service before his successors.\n",
      "We seek information about the social, religious and economic conditions of the people\n",
      "in the Mauryan period from Megasthenes’ account, Kautlya’s Asthashastra, Jain and\n",
      "Buddhist texts and Ashoka’s rock and pillar inscription.\n",
      "Social and Religious Conditions:\n",
      "The people were happy and prosperous on the whole they were self-sufficient. There\n",
      "was a high standard of social and personal morality among the Indians of his times. The\n",
      "whole Hindu society was based on the caste system Indian society was divided into\n",
      "seven classes. These list as philosophers, farmers, soldiers, herdsmen, artisan,\n",
      "magistrates and councilors. The role of women in Mauryan society is of some\n",
      "significance. It was taken for granted that their position was subordinate to that of the\n",
      "men. The birth of a son was not necessary to Buddhist ritual as it was to Hindu ritual.\n",
      "Administration:\n",
      "The Empire was divided into four provinces, with the imperial capital at Pataliputra.\n",
      "From Ashokan edicts, the names of the four provincial capitals are Tosali (in the east),\n",
      "Ujjain (in the west), Suvarnagiri (in the south), and Taxila (in the north). The head of the\n",
      "provincial administraton was the Kumara (royal prince), who governed the provinces as\n",
      "king's representatve. The kumara was assisted by Mahamatyas and council of ministers.\n",
      "This organizatonal structure was reflected at the imperial level with the Emperor and his\n",
      "Mantriparishad (Council of Ministers).\n",
      "Historians theorize that the organization of the Empire was in line with the extensive\n",
      "bureaucracy described by Kautlya in the Arthashastra: a sophisticated civil service\n",
      "governed everything from municipal hygiene to international trade. The expansion and\n",
      "defense of the empire was made possible by what appears to have been the largest\n",
      "standing army of its time.\n",
      "Religious Condition:\n",
      "The Indian society was divided into three sections in respect of religion – Hindu, Jains\n",
      "and Buddhist.\n",
      "Hinduism was the major religion at the time of inception of the empire, Hindu priests and\n",
      "ministers used to be an important part of the emperor's court, like Chanakya. Even after\n",
      "embracing Buddhism, Ashoka retained the membership of Hindu Brahmana priests and\n",
      "ministers\n",
      "in his court. Mauryan society began embracing the philosophy of ahimsa, and given the\n",
      "increased prosperity and improved law enforcement, crime and internal conflicts\n",
      "reduced dramatically. Also greatly discouraged was the caste system and orthodox\n",
      "discriminaton, as Mauryans began to absorb the ideals and values of Jain and Buddhist\n",
      "teachings along with traditional Vedic Hindu teachings.\n",
      "Ashoka initially practiced Hinduism but later embraced Buddhism; following the Kalinga\n",
      "War, he renounced expansionism and aggression, and the harsher injunctions of the\n",
      "Arthashastra on the use of force, intensive policing, and ruthless measures for tax\n",
      "collecton and against rebels. He is believed to have built as many as 84,000 stupas\n",
      "across India and he even increased the popularity of Buddhism in Afghanistan, Thailand\n",
      "and North Asia including Siberia.\n",
      "It is said that Emperor Chandragupta Maurya embraced Jainism after retiring. At an\n",
      "older age, Chandragupta renounced his throne and material possessions to join a\n",
      "wandering group of Jain monks. Further Samprat, the grandson of Ashoka also\n",
      "embraced Jainism. Thus Chandragupta and Samprat are credited for the spread of\n",
      "Jainism in South India. Lakhs of temples & stupas were erected during their reign.\n",
      "Economic Condition, Amusements and Education\n",
      "For the first time in South Asia, political unity and military security allowed for a common\n",
      "economic system and enhanced trade and commerce, with increased agricultural\n",
      "productivity. The previous situation involving hundreds of kingdoms, many small armies,\n",
      "powerful regional chieftains, and internal warfare, gave way to a disciplined central\n",
      "authority. Farmers were freed of tax and crop collection burdens from regional kings,\n",
      "paying instead to a nationally administered and strict-but-fair system of taxation as\n",
      "advised by the principles in the Arthashastra. Chandragupta Maurya established a\n",
      "single currency across India, and a network of regional governors and administrators\n",
      "and a civil service provided justice and security for merchants, farmers and traders. The\n",
      "Mauryan army wiped out many gangs of bandits, regional private armies, and powerful\n",
      "chieftains who sought to impose their own supremacy in small areas. Although\n",
      "regimental in revenue collection, Maurya also sponsored many public works and\n",
      "waterways to enhance productivity, while internal trade in India expanded greatly due to\n",
      "newfound political unity and internal peace. Under the Indo-Greek friendship treaty, and\n",
      "during Ashoka's reign, an international network of trade expanded.\n",
      "Amusements:\n",
      "People celebrated many festivals and rejoiced considerably. The change of seasons\n",
      "was always an occasion to be celebrated with appropriate amusements and gatherings,\n",
      "singings, dancing and instrumental music were widely cultivated. Among the sixty four\n",
      "arts which a well-educated man was supposed to know, dancing and music ranked high.\n",
      "Education:\n",
      "The Mauryan rulers gave much attention to the spread of education also. Asoka's edicts\n",
      "were written on rocks and pillars put up on important road and very prominent at that\n",
      "time the majority of the population was literate. The 'Gurukulas' and monasteries were\n",
      "set up many places to teach the people and propagate educaton. The pupils stayed with\n",
      "their 'gurus' (teachers) to receive education. While at the residence of the guru they\n",
      "received education they served the 'guru' by performing domestic duties of his\n",
      "household. In these 'Gurukulas' and monasteries were taught all subjects like the Vedas,\n",
      "the Puranas, Mathematcs, Astronomy, Arthashastra, and Politics etc. Taxila was the\n",
      "oldest and the most famous 'Vidyalaya' (college) of ancient India. Even 500 or 600\n",
      "years before the Mauryan Period it was considered an important university. The\n",
      "Mauryan rulers helped this university all the more and greatly raised its importance. The\n",
      "fame and reputation of Taxila University had spread all over the country as well as in\n",
      "foreign land. This university held the same position in India at that tme which Oxford\n",
      "and Cambridge have in England now a days.\n",
      "The 'Arthashastra' by Kautliya, the 'Kalpa-Sutra', by Bhadrabahu, and many 'Griha\n",
      "Sutras’ as well as 'Dharma-Sutras' were composed in this period. The most prominent\n",
      "of all these is the Arthashastra by Kautlya which is a very valuable source of informaton\n",
      "about the government and administraton of that tme. Some of the historians are of the\n",
      "view that some parts of the Ramayana and the Mahabharta were also compiled in this\n",
      "period. The important book of Buddhism, 'Katha Vathu' in Pali and many reputed books\n",
      "of Jainism, as 'Bhagwat Sutra', 'Vaikalika', 'Acharang-Sutra' etc. was also written in the\n",
      "Mauryan period.\n",
      "The Mauryan Art and Decline of the Mauryans:\n",
      "The Mauryan art represented an important transition in Indian art from use of wood to\n",
      "stone. According to Niharranjan Ray, the sum total of the Mauryan treasury of art\n",
      "include the remains of the royal palace and the city of Pataliputra, a monolithic rail at\n",
      "Sarnath, the Bodhimandala or the altar resting on four pillars at Bodhgaya, the\n",
      "excavated Chaitya-halls in the Barabar and Nagarjuni hills of Gaya including the\n",
      "Sudama cave bearing the inscription dated the 12th regional year of Ashoka, the non-\n",
      "edict bearing and edict bearing pillars, the animal sculptures crowning the pillars with\n",
      "animal and vegetal reliefs decoratng the abaci of the capitals and the front half of the\n",
      "representation of an elephant carved out in the round from a live rock at Dhauli.\n",
      "Further Coomaraswmy was of the view that the Mauryan art may be said to exhibit\n",
      "three main phases. The frst phase was the continuation of the Pre-Mauryan tradition,\n",
      "which is found in some instances to the representation of the Vedic deities (the most\n",
      "significant examples are the reliefs of Surya and Indra at the Bhaja Caves). The second\n",
      "phase was the court art of Ashoka, typically found in the monolithic columns on which\n",
      "his edicts are inscribed and the third phase was the beginning of brick and stone\n",
      "architecture, as in the case of the original stupa at Sanchi,the small monolithic rail at\n",
      "Sanchi and the Lomash Rishi cave in the Barabar Caves, with its ornamented facade,\n",
      "reproducing the forms of wooden structure.\n",
      "Talking about architecture, the period marked a second transition to use of brick and\n",
      "stone; wood was still the material of choice. Megasthenes mentions that the capital city\n",
      "of Pataliputra was encircled by a massive timber-palisade, pierced by loopholes through\n",
      "which archers could shoot. It had sixty-four gates and 570 towers. According to Strabo,\n",
      "the gilded pillars of the palace were adorned with golden vines and silver birds. The\n",
      "palace stood in an extensive park studded with fishponds. It was furnished with a great\n",
      "variety of ornamental trees and shrubs. Excavatons carried out by Spooner and\n",
      "Waddell have brought to light remains of huge wooden buildings at Bulandibagh and\n",
      "Kumrahar, both near Patna. The remains of one of the buildings, a 80 pillared hall at\n",
      "Kumrahar are of particular significance. Out of 80 stone columns, that once stood on a\n",
      "wooden platorm and supported a wooden roof, Spooner was able to discover the entre\n",
      "lower part of at least one in almost perfect conditions. It is more or less similar to an\n",
      "Ashokan pillar, smooth, polished and made of grey Chunar sandstone.\n",
      "This period also marked a creative and impressive step forward in Indian sculpting.\n",
      "Although some would consider the Pillars of Ashoka as architecture, owing to their\n",
      "freestanding nature and elaborately carved animal capitals most of the art historians\n",
      "consider them as the examples of sculpture. Coomaraswamy distnguishes between\n",
      "court art and a more popular art during the Mauryan period. Court art is represented by\n",
      "the pillars and their capitals. Popular art is represented by the works of the local\n",
      "sculptors like chauri-bearer from Didarganj.\n",
      "Discussing the court art first the Mauryan pillars were carved in two types of stone\n",
      "quarried from Chunar near Varanasi. The uniformity of style in the pillar capitals\n",
      "suggests that they were all sculpted by craftsmen from the same region. They were\n",
      "given a fine polish characteristc of Mauryan sculpture. These pillars were mainly\n",
      "erected in the Gangetc plains. They were inscribed with edicts of Ashoka on Dhamma\n",
      "or righteousness. The animal capital is a finely carved life like representaton.\n",
      "Noteworthy are the lion capital of Sarnath, the bull capital of Rampurva and the lion\n",
      "capital of Laurya Nandangarh. Much speculation has been made about the similarity\n",
      "between these capitals and Achaemenid works.\n",
      "Apart from the mention of court art there are enough evidences of popular art during the\n",
      "Mauryan Period. The work of local sculptors illustrated the popular art of the Mauryan\n",
      "period. This consisted of sculpture which may not probably was not commissioned by\n",
      "the emperor. The patrons of the popular art were the local governors and the more well\n",
      "to do subjects. It is represented by figures such as the female figure of Besnagar, the\n",
      "male figure of Parkham and the whisk-bearer from Didarganj. Technically they are\n",
      "fashioned with less skill than the pillar capitals and hey express a considerable\n",
      "earthiness and physical vitality. Terracotta objects of various sizes have also been\n",
      "found at Mauryan sites. Some appear to have been made from molds, yet there is little\n",
      "duplication. Terracotta’s from Taxila consists of primitive idols, votive reliefs with deities,\n",
      "toys dice, ornaments and beads. Among the ornaments were round medallions, similar\n",
      "to the bullae worn by Roman boys. Ringtones probably associated with a fertility cult\n",
      "have also been found in some quantty. Terracotta images of folk gods and goddesses,\n",
      "which have been found having an earthy charm.\n",
      "Mauryan art is also notable for a refinement in pottery Use of the potter’s wheel became\n",
      "universal. The pottery associated with Mauryan period consists of many types of ware.\n",
      "But the most highly developed technique is seen in a special type of pottery known as\n",
      "the Northern Black Polished Ware (NBPW), which was the hallmark of Mauryan pottery.\n",
      "The NBP ware is made of finely levitated alluvial clay, which when seen in section is\n",
      "usually of a grey and sometimes of a red hue. It has a brilliantly burnished dressing of\n",
      "the quality of a glaze, which ranges from a jet black to a deep grey or a metallic steel\n",
      "blue. This ware was used largely for dishes and small bowls.\n",
      "Another art piece of economic importance is the coins. The coins issued by the\n",
      "Mauryans are mostly silver and a few copper pieces of metal in various shapes, sizes\n",
      "and weights and which have one or more symbols punched on them. The most\n",
      "common symbols are the elephant, the tree in railing symbol and the mountain. The\n",
      "technique of producing such coins was generally that the metal was cut first and then\n",
      "the device was punched. These symbols are said to have either represented the Royal\n",
      "insignia or the symbol of the local guild that struck the coin.\n",
      "The Decline of the Mauryans:\n",
      "The exact cause of the rapid decline of the Maurya dynasty (within fifty years of\n",
      "Ashoka's reign) is now known. Many factors must have contributed to the final\n",
      "overthrow. One reason could be that Ashoka, in his enthusiasm, typical of the newly\n",
      "converted, to follow the tenets of Buddhism, issued a new set of rulers for the public,\n",
      "such as the ban on animal sacrifces, samajams (social gatherings) and other popular\n",
      "pastimes and festivals. This deprived the people of the freedom to worship in the\n",
      "customary manner their favourite deites especially the grama devatas (village gods).\n",
      "Furthermore, those who carried out Ashoka's orders in the various provinces were strict\n",

      "Hello students!\n",
      "Today we are going to talk about the Mauryan Pillars with the aim of understanding the\n",
      "construction and purpose behind the erection of these pillars.\n",
      "The Mauryan Empire is well known for its remarkable achievements in the fields of art,\n",
      "architecture, literature as well as culture. The Mauryan pillars are considered to be one of the\n",
      "key works as well as prominent features marking the Mauryan supremacy. These pillars, till\n",
      "today, stand as a testimony to the rich architecture which flourished during the reign of this\n",
      "empire.\n",
      "Ashoka ascended to the throne in 269 BC inheriting the empire established by his grandfather\n",
      "Chandragupta Maurya. Ashoka was reputedly a dictator at the onset of his reign. Eight years\n",
      "after his accession he campaigned in Kalinga where in his own words, \"a hundred and fifty\n",
      "thousand people were deported, a hundred thousand were killed and as many as that\n",
      "perished...\" After this event Ashoka adapted to Buddhism in regret for the loss of so many lives.\n",
      "Buddhism didn't become a state religion but with Ashoka's support it spread rapidly. The\n",
      "inscriptions on the pillars described edicts about morality based on Buddhist doctrines.\n",
      "The Mauryan pillars or pillars of Ashoka also known as lats are a series of columns dispersed\n",
      "throughout the northern Indian subcontinent, erected or at least inscribed with edicts by the\n",
      "Mauryan king Ashoka during his reign in the 3rd century BC. Originally, there must have been\n",
      "many pillars but only nineteen survive with inscriptions. Many are preserved in a fragmented\n",
      "state. Averaging between forty and fifty feet in height, and weighing up to fifty tons each, all the\n",
      "pillars were quarried at Chunar, just south of Varanasi and dragged, sometimes hundreds of\n",
      "miles, to where they were erected.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "The significance of the pillars is not difficult to determine. The origin of the pillar as a\n",
      "structure goes back to the monolith of the prehistoric period. These were generally cut from a\n",
      "single block of stone and stood in an enclosure which was regarded as sacred.\n",
      "Sometimes they were worshipped as a phallic emblem or linga. The advantage of inscribing a\n",
      "text on such a pillar was that of associating the text with a place of importance. The Mauryan\n",
      "Pillars therefore serve as the best examples of the use of art for the purpose of propagating\n",
      "religion through the medium of the edicts inscribed on them.\n",
      "Leaving behind their Buddhistic significance the Ashokan pillars are expressive of a very\n",
      "ancient widespread belief, and were in the first instance inspired by man worshipping among the\n",
      "groves and great trees of the forest. With the reverence for trees came veneration for huge\n",
      "stones and boulders, the sacred and mystical character given to them being but a prelude to\n",
      "shaping them into upright forms. Columns were gods in early days and the forerunner of the\n",
      "temples. Apart from this the terrific level of craftsmanship itself speaks volumes about the\n",
      "greatness of the Mauryan period.\n",
      "Subject Matter: The highly polished, tall and well-proportioned columns with slightly tapering\n",
      "monolithic shafts, and standing free in space and complete and independent by themselves are\n",
      "admittedly the best representatives of the court art of the Mauryas. The pillars set up by Ashoka\n",
      "furnish the finest remains of the Mauryan art. Here it is important to mention the evolution of\n",
      "these outstanding structures.\n",
      "Evolution of the Ashokan Pillars\n",
      "Here it is important to mention the evolution of these outstanding structures. Possessed of great\n",
      "ideals, as Ashokas policy throughout plainly indicates, one of this rulers most earnest desires\n",
      "appears to have been to institute a permanent record of the establishment of the Buddhist faith\n",
      "within his widely-spread dominions. A craving for a symbol of stability occurs in the early\n",
      "evolution of most nations, a need for some substantial link which holds them to the soil and is a\n",
      "stage in the development of racial self-consciousness. This thought might be the reason behind\n",
      "initiating the carving of his famous edicts on the living rocks, proclaiming as they do, in plain\n",
      "terms that his efforts should result in the long endurance of the Good Law. These inscriptions,\n",
      "although many have survived, were not, however, sufficiently striking to suit his purpose; what\n",
      "was evidently in his progressive mind was the creation of a memorial of such a permanent nature\n",
      "that it would outlast time itself. With this in view he caused to be raised in many parts of his\n",
      "empire Stupas, which were circular tumuli of brick, sacred mounds commemorative of the\n",
      "Buddha. But as the Stupa from the nature of its structure was subject to disintegration owing to\n",
      "the rigours of the climate, it became necessary for the Mauryan Emperor to seek for some still\n",
      "more lasting method of achieving his purpose. Aware no doubt that the other nations were using\n",
      "stone, he began therefore to think in stone and in the course of time an impressive monument\n",
      "symbolizing the creed was devised in the form of a pillar, a lofty free-standing monolithic column,\n",
      "erected on a site especially selected on account of its sacred associations. A number of these\n",
      "Ashokan pillars were distributed over a wide area and a few bear ordinances inscribed in a\n",
      "manner similar to the edicts on the surfaces of the rock.\n",
      "Discovery:\n",
      "The first Pillar of Ashoka was found in the 16th century by Thomas Coryat in the ruins of ancient\n",
      "Delhi. Initially he assumed that from the way it glowed that it was made of brass, but on closer\n",
      "examination he realized it was made of highly polished sandstone with upright script that\n",
      "resembled a form of Greek. In the 1830s James Prinsep began to decipher them with the help of\n",
      "Captain Edward Smith and George Turnour. They determined that the script referred to King\n",
      "Piyadasi which was also the epithet of an Indian ruler known as Ashoka who came to the throne\n",
      "218 years after Buddha's enlightenment. Scholars have since found 150 of Ashoka's\n",
      "inscriptions, carved into the face of rocks or on stone pillars marking out a domain that stretched\n",
      "across northern India and south below the central plateau of the Deccan. These pillars were\n",
      "placed in strategic sites near border cities and trade routes.\n",
      "Material used for their construction: These pillars are fashioned out of grey Chunar\n",
      "sandstone and stand directly on the ground without any masonry platform or base, having\n",
      "been kept in position by being simply buried in the ground, sometimes fixed to a socket hole in\n",
      "the middle of a large undressed block of stone. The shafts, plain and circular in section, have\n",
      "each a slight taper upwards. Each is chiseled out of a single block of stone, the capital\n",
      "surmounting it being of another piece and fixed to the top of the shaft by means of a copper\n",
      "dowel.\n",
      "Various parts: The capital is divided into three sections, namely a double-curved inverted lotus\n",
      "(commonly known as the ` Persepolitan bell`: Agarwala recognizes in this motif an inverted\n",
      "purna-ghata) surmounted by an abacus or socle that supports an animal sculpture or sculptures\n",
      "in the round. The entire column with the capital is distinguished by a precision of modeling and\n",
      "bears on the finished surface a highly lustrous polish the composition of which is still a matter for\n",
      "investigation. Several mouldings of variable designs are usually introduced to render the\n",
      "transition from the shaft to the capital easy and graceful. -- In this connection it may not be out of\n",
      "place to refer to the possibility that some of these pillars might have been standing from before\n",
      "the days of Ashoka. This is suggested by the Rupnath and the Sassaram edicts and Pillar edicts\n",
      "No. VII where Ashoka says that rescripts of the law of piety should be engraved on rocks and on\n",
      "stone pillars (Silathuva) , wherever such pillars might have been standing. It is not impossible,\n",
      "hence, that the idea of the Edict pillars was first suggested to Ashoka by some pre-existing pillars\n",
      "which he also thought of utilizing in his new mission. Indeed, a close examination of some of\n",
      "these pillars clearly indicates them as having been apart from the more well-known Edict\n",
      "Columns.\n",
      "Description of the pillars - I\n",
      "The columns that bear the edicts of Ashoka include the two pillars at Delhi (originally located at\n",
      "Meerut and Topra in Haryana and were brought to Delhi during the reign of Firuz Shah\n",
      "Tughluq in 1356), the pillar at Allahabad (is believed as originally located at Kaushambi) and\n",
      "the pillars found at Lauriya-Areraj, Lauriya-Nandangarh, Rampurva (with lion capital),\n",
      "Sankasya, Sanchi and Sarnath. The columns bearing dedicatory inscriptions were found in\n",
      "Lumbini and Nigalisagar. The pillars found at Vaishali (with single lion capital) and Rampurva\n",
      "(with bull capital) do not bear any edict. The inscriptions are in Brahmi and Kharoshthi, the\n",
      "earliest examples of deciphered scripts from India.\n",
      "The most important sculptural remains of the Mauryan period are the capitals and the\n",
      "crowning animal figures on the Ashokan edicts pillars. Some of the Ashokan edicts were carved\n",
      "on already existing pillars, as for example the Basarh-Bakhira (ancient Vaisali) lion pillar where\n",
      "the workmanship is crude and rough. The location of this pillar is contiguous to the site where a\n",
      "Buddhist monastery and a sacred coronation tank stood. Excavations are still underway and\n",
      "several stupas suggesting a far flung campus for the monastery have been discovered. This pillar\n",
      "is different from the earlier Ashokan pillars because it has only one lion capital. The lion faces\n",
      "north, the direction Buddha took on his last voyage. Identification of the site for excavation in\n",
      "1969 was aided by the fact that this pillar still jutted out of the soil. More such pillars exist in this\n",
      "greater area but they are all devoid of the capital. On stylistic grounds, the figures can be divided\n",
      "into two groups: the sophisticated but conventional lion and the cruder but very powerfully\n",
      "modeled representations of the bull and elephant. The one at Basarh- Bakhira marks the earliest\n",
      "stage in their development; probably it is pre-Ashokan. Compared with the other columns of\n",
      "known Ashokan dates the shaft of this column is heavy and of a shorter proportions, and its\n",
      "workmanship crude and rough. The plain square abacus which is by itself an almost sure\n",
      "indication of an earlier date, has no integral relation with the bell-capital below, and is, moreover,\n",
      "out of proportion. The crowning lion ærecouchantÆ, though a free and independent figure, is not\n",
      "only rough and crude in execution, but has not yet evolved a form and appearance so as to make\n",
      "of itself an integrated whole together with the shaft, the capital and the abacus.\n",
      "Further the elephant at Sankasya and the Rampurva bull illustrate the transition from the\n",
      "Basarh-Bakhira lion to the Lauriya Nandangarh capital. The Sankasya pillar itself shows an\n",
      "improvement in the change from a square to a round abacus, thus making the transition from\n",
      "the capital to the animal more harmonious. The decoration on the abacus and the manner of\n",
      "filling the space between the legs are rather primitive û probably copies of wooden models.\n",
      "The Rampurva bull capital shows stylistic similarities with the Sankasya capital. The bull\n",
      "bears a striking resemblance to those on the Indus seals. Though the technique is less\n",
      "sophisticated than in the lion figure , the modeling and form of the animal appears vigorous.\n",
      "The volume, following closely the anatomical details, reveals keen observation of nature and\n",
      "understanding on the animal form. Unfortunately, this naturalistic representation of the bull\n",
      "does not harmonies with the conventional pattern of the abacus. The decoration on the\n",
      "abacus, consisting of rosettes and honeysuckle, appears a little rough.\n",
      "The lion capitals at Rampurva and Lauriya Nandangarh are chronologically close to the\n",
      "Rampurva bull capital. The Rampurva lion capital resembles an inverted lotus with the petals\n",
      "clearly marked. It retains some of the lustrous polish. A line of geese adorns the round abacus.\n",
      "The crowning statue on top represents a seated lion, with muscles, veins and paws skillfully\n",
      "carved. The uniform curls of the mane shows the schematic repetition of the same design. The\n",
      "whole is represented in a conventional way. On the tall and graceful pillars of Lauriya\n",
      "Nandangarh we see another seated lion. This frequent use of the lion figure could be due to the\n",
      "fact that it symbolized one of the cardinal directions. The lion seems to be uncomfortably fitted\n",
      "into the round abacus, with parts of the body projecting beyond it.\n",
      "Description of the pillars - II\n",
      "The quadripartite lion capitals of Sarnath and Sanchi mark the last stage in the evolution. Lion\n",
      "capital at Sarnath is the most celebrated pillar erected at Sarnath (Uttar Pradesh) by Emperor\n",
      "Ashoka circa 250 BC., also known as \"Ashoka Columnö. Here, four lions are seated back to\n",
      "back. At present the Column remains in the same place where as Lion Capital is at the Sarnath\n",
      "Museum. This capital consists of an inverted lotus with gently curved petals. On the round\n",
      "abacus above it are high relief carvings of a lion, a galloping horse, an elephant and a bull,\n",
      "separated from each other by a wheel. These animals represents the four points of the compass;\n",
      "the lion north, the horse south, the elephant east, and the bull west, for the Buddhists believed\n",
      "them to be the guardians of the four cardinal points. In this abacus, they symbolize the\n",
      "continuous movement and unceasing progress of the dharma chakra, destined to spread\n",
      "throughout the world. The freshness and naturalism of the animal figures on the abacus contrast\n",
      "strongly with the four conventionalized lions above. Sitting back to back on top of the abacus,\n",
      "they echo the essential shape of the stylized lotus. Though the rippling curls of the mane, the\n",
      "upturned whiskers and the shape of the lips are conventionalized, the snarling mouth and bare\n",
      "teeth look very real. The leg muscles and paws are powerfully modeled also, and the curved\n",
      "claws seem to express all the native ferocity of the animals. Originally, the lions supported a\n",
      "dharmachakra, the remains of which are still visible on the backs of the animals. The lion heads,\n",
      "with incised parallel lines representing the muzzle, and eyes in a triangular shape, resemble\n",
      "Persian lion figures. Though the sophisticated conception seems to confirm the Achaemenid\n",
      "influence, only experience could have resulted in the advance to naturalism seen in these\n",
      "animals. The Sarnath lion capital no serves as the emblem of the Indian Republic.\n",
      "The Sanchi capital, resembling the one at Sarnath, is even more conventional and stylized. The\n",
      "higher and narrower relief of the abacus frieze eases the transition from the capital to the\n",
      "crowning figures better than at Sarnath.\n",
      "Again, the animals forming the crowning members of the capitals of the pillars are not\n",
      "particularly associated with Buddhism alone. Lion, either singly or in group of four, appears on\n",
      "the majority of the capitals, elephant on the Sankasya, bull at Rampurwa and in a group of four\n",
      "at Salempur and Horse at Rummindei. These four are also represented round the abacus of the\n",
      "quadri-partite capital at Sarnath.\n",
      "Some scholars try to find a specific Buddhist association of these animals: lion means the ` lion of\n",
      "the Sakya clan`( Sakyasimha); elephant is associated with the legend of the conception of the\n",
      "Buddha ; horse with that of the `Great Renunciation`; bull to denote the Buddha who was often\n",
      "addressed as muni-pungava or as Sakya-pungava. These animals are sacred to Brahmanism\n",
      "and, to a certain extent, to Jainism also. The Lauriya Araraj column, which in all probability, was\n",
      "crowned by the figure of Garuda, may be regarded to have a distinct Brahmanical association. In\n",
      "this situation it is difficult to consider these animal capitals in any sectarian context. The view of\n",
      "Agarwala seems to be more convincing. He identifies the lion, the elephant, the bull and the\n",
      "horse as the four ` noble` animals (maha ajaneya pasu) held sacred in Indian tradition for a long\n",
      "time past and for a long time after. Raising of such animal standards must have been common\n",
      "and it is not impossible to regard at least some of the Ashokan pillars as but translation in stone\n",
      "of the primitive animals standard.\n",
      "Besides these animal figures on the pillars, another piece of sculpture, the elephant at Dhauli,\n",
      "carved out of the living rock, strikes an essentially indigenous note quite different from the art\n",
      "traditions of the capitals. The voluminous mass shows plasticity and knowledge of the animal\n",
      "form. The slightly raised right leg and flowing trunk accentuate the animal`s forward movement.\n",
      "Compared with this elephant, the lion figure seems too conventional. Stylistically it does not\n",
      "come much latter than the elephant capital at Sankasya. The unconventional Dhauli elephant as\n",
      "well as the Rampurva bull and Sankasya elephant seems to belong to a different artistic\n",
      "tradition- perhaps that of the Indus valley. These animal forms are not schematic-nascent life\n",
      "seems to stir within them. This indigenous quality saw further development in the subsequent\n",
      "periods of the Sunga and Early Andhra dynasties.\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Thus to conclude we can say that these pillars are the master-pieces of Mauryan Art in the\n",
      "shining polish imparted to them which is supposed to be the despair of modern masons, and in\n",
      "the degree of perfection in which, they were shaped, dressed, and decorated in accordance with\n",
      "the Emperor’s design. They carried to a high standard the art of the delineation of natural forms\n",
      "of animals and plants in stone. They are also notable as feats of engineering when it is\n",
      "considered that all these pillars weighing on an average 50 tons, and measuring a height of 50\n",
      "feet, are all monolithic productions, showing how large masses of rocks were shaped into these\n",
      "pillars, and also how these great weights were handled for the purposes of their transport over\n",
      "distances of several hundreds of miles to their appointed sites at which they were to be located in\n",
      "accordance with the imperial scheme of public welfare which they were intended to serve. For\n",
      "instance, a chain of pillars was called for to indicate the Pilgrims Progress towards the holy lands\n",
      "of Buddhism from Pataliputra to the place of Buddhas nativity.\n",
      "So with this we come to the end of this lecture and i am sure that by now you must have\n",
      "got a clear picture about the various Mauryan pillars.Thank you.\n",

      "Hello Students!\n",
      "Today we are going to talk about the various differences that are evident in the\n",
      "construction of the Mauryan Pillars about which we have already studied in my earlier\n",
      "lecture titled Mauryan Pillars. And our aim in today’s lecture would be to study in detail\n",
      "both the outside and Indian influences on these art pieces also known as Ashokan\n",
      "Pillars. We begin by a brief reference to the source of the culture from which Ashoka\n",
      "drew his inspiration seems to be mentioned. From 500 B.C. and the ensuing 170\n",
      "years the pulse of Asiatic culture throbbed in what was then the fertile land of Persia,\n",
      "and as a result there developed in the capital cities of that great empire, the nearest to\n",
      "India, a classical art school composed of Pharoic-Hellenic-Iranian elements of a\n",
      "distinctively effective character. This school was probably partially dispersed by\n",
      "Alexander’s conquest of Persia together with the downfall of the Achaemenid dynasty\n",
      "in 330 B.C., but the unsettled period which then ensued was rapidly followed by the\n",
      "extension of the Macedonian empire in the east by means of Greek colonies, such as\n",
      "that of Bactria, which brought the full force of Hellenism to the very borders of\n",
      "Mauryan India. What actually happened to the exponents of the original Achaemenid\n",
      "school under such conditions can only be a matter of conjecture but that they and their\n",
      "successors continues to flourish under the intelligent patronage of the Asiatic Greeks,\n",
      "producing works with still more marked Hellenistic features cannot be doubted. It was\n",
      "at this stage of the movement that the Indian emperor Ashoka conceived the project of\n",
      "erecting his imperishable and symbolic monuments to the Buddhist faith, and\n",
      "instinctively turned to the descendants of the workmen who had already shown such\n",
      "proficiency in their construction of the stately palaces of the Persian kings.\n",
      "To attain his object the Mauryan monarch adopted the common practice of royal art\n",
      "patronage, and brought into his service a group of experienced foreign artists of a\n",
      "sufficiently adaptable nature to put into effect his progressive ideas. Historical\n",
      "instances of such a procedure are numerous, but some of those, which account for\n",
      "the particular character of the Achaemenid art of Eastern Persia and in the course of\n",
      "time of that of the Ashokan School, have a direct bearing on the style, which\n",
      "afterwards appeared in the Buddhist India.\n",
      "In these circumstances it is not difficult to account for the form and character that\n",
      "the giant pillar and the other lithic productions of the Ashokan period assumed. From\n",
      "the columned halls reared under the orders of the Achaemenid kings, form their\n",
      "sculptured reliefs and their inscriptions on the rocks, the Indian monarch obtained\n",
      "some of his inspiration, and from the ranks of those who produced them he secured\n",
      "the skill artificers to aid him in his projects. In short it may be presumed with some\n",
      "degree of certainty that, attracted by the emperor’s assured patronage, there was\n",
      "eventually gathered in a quarry workshop near Chunar in Bihar a small group of\n",
      "imported workmen trained in Graeco-Persian traditions and engaged to collaborate\n",
      "with a number of selected Indian craftsmen to fashion the first dressed stone objects\n",
      "to be produced on Indian soil. Of the achievements of this composite school\n",
      "established by Ashoka, the freestanding pillars are unquestionably the most notable.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "Finding expression from wood in another and more lasting material such as\n",
      "dressed-stone is a decisive step in the cultural evolution of the people. But the manner\n",
      "in which this step was taken under Ashoka’s direction, and the results it produced are\n",
      "both of more than ordinary significance. Appearing as these sculptured forms do, fully\n",
      "matured, at a time when Indian art was still in its infancy, and without any previous\n",

      "There can be no doubt that the motivation came from outside. The very sudden use\n",
      "of stone and that at once for monumental art of large designs and huge proportions,\n",
      "and the quick process of evolution from primitive to conscious, civilized and cultured\n",
      "form and appearance, from tribal to imperial outlook that is evident in the total effect of\n",
      "the columns point unmistakably in that direction. It has been repeatedly suggested,\n",
      "not without reason that this unnecessary motivation and inspiration came from Iran of\n",
      "the Achaemenid emperor; some have even suggested that Mauryan columns are but\n",
      "Indian adaptations of the Achaemenian prototype. As repeatedly attempts have been\n",
      "made to deny the alleged extent of debt, not again without a certain amount of justice;\n",
      "but few have seriously doubted that west Asiatic art forms in general and\n",
      "Achaemenian impetus and inspiration directly and in particular were at work at the\n",
      "root. Nor against the background of what we know of Mauryan relation with Hellenic\n",
      "East and the Mauryan court ideology and tradition deeply tinged with Achaemenian\n",
      "ideas were such impetus and inspiration unlikely, especially when we take into\n",
      "account the extent of Achaemenian influence on Ashokan epigraphs, his imperial idea\n",
      "and policy and the conception of the Mauryan Pillared Hall. But the differences that\n",
      "separate the Mauryan columns from the Achaemenian ones are also considerable\n",
      "and must not be lost sight of.\n",
      "The stone columns of the Mauryan Pillared Hall were evidently without capitals\n",
      "whereas the columns of the pillared halls of Persepolis are provided with more or less\n",
      "elaborate capitals. Achaemenian columns stand either on bell shaped bases or on\n",
      "plain rectangular blocks or on plain circular moldings while the independent Mauryan\n",
      "columns have no base at all. The bell form that is used as supporting base in Persian\n",
      "columns serves as capital in Mauryan ones and makes altogether a different aesthetic\n",
      "effect; and moreover in form, shape and appearance the Mauryan bell, which along\n",
      "with the Achaemenian may have originally been derived from stylized lotus design and\n",
      "which may have been a common art-motif in both Indian and Iranian art-heritage, is a\n",
      "long way off from the Achaemenian bell in which a ring of leaves and petals plays an\n",
      "important part in the decoration of the upper end of the motif and which has no bulge\n",
      "whatsoever in the middle that makes the Mauryan bell so gaily and conspicuous.\n",
      "Mauryan columns are all plain and circular, but evidently they did not adopt the type\n",
      "from Achaemenian inflated ones which had for ordinary purposes been discarded by\n",
      "the Achaemenians themselves. A funeral mound at Lauriya Nandangarh has yielded\n",
      "to the excavator`s spade a plain and circular piece of a column carved out of sila\n",
      "wood: such columns are in our literature known as sthuna, and the primitive animal\n",
      "standards were evidently comprised of such sthuna columns. It is not unlikely that the\n",
      "Mauryan shaft was derived from such wooden originals. The assumption derives\n",
      "further support from the fact that Achaemenian shafts are indeed built of separate\n",
      "pieces or segments of stones and evidently present the essential character of the\n",
      "work of a mason, while the Mauryan shaft is once piece, which pertains to the\n",
      "character of the work of a wood-carver or carpenter. The Achaemenian capitals\n",
      "crowned with a cluster of stylized palm leaves after the old Egyptian manner, and\n",
      "formed of either of two semi bulls or unicorns or lions seated back to back, or of an\n",
      "upright or inverted cup, and the whole crowned with projecting double volutes have\n",
      "nothing whatsoever in common with the Mauryan capital which consist as we have\n",
      "seen, of simply a bell formed of stylized lotus-petal. The crowning abacus and the\n",
      "round and independent animal motif of Mauryan columns are also altogether absent\n",
      "from Achaemenian examples.\n",
      "The result achieved by this almost thorough transformation is altogether different.\n",
      "The Achaemenian column intended invariably as part of a larger architectural\n",
      "conception is composed of much too many component parts presenting harsh\n",
      "contrasts and looking complex and complicated, while the Mauryan column intended\n",
      "to produce the effect of an independent monument at least in its latest and best\n",
      "specimen is simpler, more harmonious in conception and execution and gives the\n",
      "feeling of greater stability, dignity and strength, born perhaps of other primitive and\n",
      "elemental origins.\n",
      "The capital at Nandangarh, which appears slightly stunted in its proportion, while\n",
      "the abacus and other features are somewhat different, so that it is possible that this\n",
      "particular example was an early and experimental effort. There may be some symbolic\n",
      "connexion between the campaniform capital and the bell (ghanta), as this in a\n",
      "conventional form, was used early in Indian decoration, and it also figures prominently\n",
      "in the temple ritual. But the boldly marked fluting the section of which is unmistakable,\n",
      "has an undoubted foreign origin, exactly similar fluting being not uncommon on\n",
      "Persian and Greek pillars, as may be seen on the capitals of the Ionic temples of\n",
      "Apollo. Above the Ashokan capital is a circular abacus having its broad edge carved\n",
      "with ornamental borders of a special character. On some of these are repetitions of\n",
      "Buddhist emblems, as for example the goose (hamsa), but on the others, as in the\n",
      "case of the bull capital at Rampurva, there are such well-known conventional motifs\n",
      "as the honeysuckle and palmette, the bead and fillet, and the cable moulding, each\n",
      "one of direct Hellenic extraction.\n",
      "It is however in the massive Buddhist composition poised above the abacus that\n",
      "the greatest imagination has been shown, and symbolism utilized to its utmost extent.\n",
      "Most of the superstructures consist of figures of animals, each of which has a\n",
      "mythological meaning. Together they symbolize the four quarters of the universe, the\n",
      "elephant being the guardian of the east, the horse of the south, the bull, of the west\n",
      "and the lion of the north. All four animals are carved in relief on the abacus at Sarnath,\n",
      "by far the finest of the entire group, evidently signifying that, although this pillar was\n",
      "primarily associated with the north by its position and conventional group of lions\n",
      "above, it was also intended to commemorate by the addition of the great wheel which\n",
      "these beasts support, the proclamation of the Good Law of the Church of the Four\n",
      "Quarters. Such were the Buddhist interpretations, but not a little of this animal\n",
      "symbolism was drawn, in the first instance, from Vedic sources. The Rig Veda gives\n",
      "the place of honour among all wild beasts to the lion, which roamed in the jungles of\n",
      "India until comparatively recent times, while a swift or galloping horse represented the\n",
      "sun and the bull Indra the sky-god, all of which are illustrated on the abacus of the\n",
      "Sarnath Capital. From this and other evidences it is clear that much of the primitive\n",
      "Buddhist symbolism as expressed in the art was a continuation of the Vedic\n",
      "mythology.\n",
      "Subject Matter - II\n",
      "It is somewhat curious that the lions in Mauryan art are always and invariably done\n",
      "in a manner that seems already to have been fixed by convention. Their formal pose\n",
      "and appearance, the rendering of their volume, bold and vigorous but stylized, their\n",
      "plastic conception in one word, and the sense of form as revealed in them are on the\n",
      "whole the same and already pre-determined. The trend of the style is already evident\n",
      "in Basarh-Bakhira lion and it is within the limits of the given trend that the style evolves\n",
      "and advances in treatment and execution. The aesthetic vision and imagination and\n",
      "the attitude and outlook of the artist do not mark any definite change. This is partly\n",
      "true as well of the lion, the horse and the bull on the Sarnath abacus. It raises the\n",
      "presumption that this style and convention came from outside where they were\n",
      "already fixed and well established. The horse on the Sarnath abacus in its movement\n",
      "modeling recalls the two horses in the relief on the Sarcophagus of the Amazons; the\n",
      "vigorously striding lion and the bull recalls well known Achaemenian prototypes of the\n",
      "same style and convention. Even the elephants on the abacus have a distant kinship\n",
      "with the horned elephants on the early coins of the Seleucids, though the Sarnath\n",
      "elephant is much less conventional and shows somewhat a different sense of form\n",
      "and treatment. The aesthetic vision and imagination and the conventional style and\n",
      "fixed expression just spoken of are most evident in the crowning lions. Compared with\n",
      "later figural sculptures in the rounds of Yakshas and their female counterparts or the\n",
      "reliefs of Bharhut, Sanchi and Bodhgaya, they are represented by these crowning\n",
      "lions belongs to an altogether different world of conception and execution, of style and\n",
      "technique, altogether much more complex, urban and civilized. They have nothing\n",
      "archaic or primitive about them, and the presumption is irresistible that the impetus\n",
      "and inspiration of this art must have come from outside.\n",
      "Marshall therefore argued for Hellenistic plastic tradition as practiced by Graeco-\n",
      "Bactrian artist. From what we know of the Hellenistic colonies in West Asia and the\n",
      "part they played in Mauryan India, it is possible, nay highly probable, that Hellenistic\n",
      "art and culture played also a very dominant role in Mauryan Art. The Mauryan lions\n",
      "indeed in their aesthetic conception and plastic vision, in their conventional modeling,\n",
      "advanced visualization; feeling or volume and sense of form invariably recall\n",
      "conventional and decadent colonial Greek works of the same art form and design. It is\n",
      "here that we can trace the source of the impetus and inspiration of the conventional\n",
      "art of the crowning lions of Mauryan columns. Here then, in a tradition familiar with\n",
      "lions and bulls and horses, was the convention fixed and determined. It is difficult to\n",
      "say anything about the nationality of the artists of the Maurya court; there is no\n",
      "evidence on the point. But from what has been said above, it is permissible to assume\n",
      "that the Dhauli elephant, the Rampurva bull and perhaps also the Sankissa elephant\n",
      "are works of Indian artist working in contemporary Indian style and tradition, and\n",
      "having a thorough mastery of the third dimension and a full consciousness of the\n",
      "Indian outlook. The crowning lions of the early phases, namely the Basarh-Bakhira\n",
      "and Lauriya Nandangarh examples are also works of Indian artists but tutored in the\n",
      "style and tradition of contemporary Western art; this is marked in the grappling with\n",
      "the problem of form and its precise execution evident in these sculptures. There is\n",
      "decided advance in the Rampurva, Sarnath and Sanchi specimens; this may have\n",
      "been achieved by the same Indian artists working increasing in the direction of\n",
      "contemporary Western art, or by colonial artists of the Hellenistic Orient imported by\n",
      "the Mauryan Court. In any case, they are in these specimens a strong and undeniable\n",
      "Hellenistic stamp that may not have been imprinted by Indian hands.\n",
      "In sharing the credit for these masterpieces, it is felt that the symbolism and\n",
      "imagination, their spiritual message so to speak, was supplied by the Indian mind\n",
      "while most of the technical skill, together with certain decorative elements, were the\n",
      "work of the imported craftsmen. But the brilliant polish which gives such a finality to\n",
      "the work was the result of Indian thought and Labour, as there is evidence of an\n",
      "indigenous aptitude in this aspect of the stone-cutters’ art.\n",
      "Conclusion:\n",
      "Thus the relationship of these edict pillars of Ashoka with those of Achaemenid Iran\n",
      "has often been stressed. The influence of West Asiatic factors in the art and culture of\n",
      "the period cannot be seriously denied in view of the close contact existing at this time\n",
      "between India and other West Asiatic countries. But it is rather difficult to regard the\n",
      "Mauryan pillars merely as imitations, or adaptations, of the Achaemenid proto-types.\n",
      "There are tangible differences between the two in their respective functions, as well in\n",
      "their conceptions and styles. Unfortunately, such differences have usually been\n",
      "ignored. Not belonging to any architectural composition, the function of the Mauryan\n",
      "pillars is totally different-a difference that is also reflected in their design and form. The\n",
      "Mauryan pillar, unlike the Achaemenid, does not stand on any base, nor does it exhibit\n",
      "the channeling or fluting which is invariably characteristic of the latter. Moreover, the\n",
      "shaft of the Mauryan pillar is, without exception, monolithic; the Achaemenian\n",
      "invariably composed of separate segments of stone aggregated one above the other.\n",
      "Again, in technique, the Mauryan pillars partakes the character of wood-carver`s or\n",
      "carpenter`s work, the Achaemenian, that of a mason. Finally, the design as well as the\n",
      "shape of the capitals is different, due, no doubt, to the new conception of the Mauryan\n",
      "pillars as standing free in space. The supposed resemblance of the so-called `bell` in\n",
      "the Indian pillar with that of the Persepolitan is merely superficial. It should be\n",
      "remembered also that the member, with which analogy is drawn, usually appears in\n",
      "the Achaemenid column at the base and not as the capital, as in the Indian pillars.\n",
      "The double curves of the Indian member surmounted by animal sculptures in the\n",
      "round exemplify rather a new order of capital, which is distinctive of India alone. This\n",
      "loti form member, representing either an inverted lotus or a purna-ghata, is entirely in\n",
      "accord with Indian tradition and it would be futile not to recognize its Indian origin. The\n",
      "real affinities with the West are recognized in the use of such decorative motifs as the\n",
      "honey-suckle, the acanthus, the `knop and flower` pattern, etc. But in view of the wide\n",
      "divergences in form, design and conception, a borrowing from the Achaemenian pillar\n",
      "design cannot truly explain the Indo-Iranian affinities. India had long been a part of the\n",
      "West Asiatic culture complex and the key to the problem lies, as Coomaraswamy\n",
      "observes, in “inheritance of common artistic traditions.”\n",
      "Finally we can conclude by saying that the indigenous and original contribution to\n",
      "the creation of this item of Mauryan art is therefore undeniable. Equally undeniable is\n",
      "also the fact that on their lustrous varnish, in their adoption and adaptation of the bell-\n",
      "shaped capital, in the higher place of conception and driving idea and in the general\n",
      "monumental and dignified quality and appearance they exhibit, the Mauryan columns\n",
      "seems to reveal clearly the debt they owe to Achaemenian art, as well as to\n",
      "Hellenistic Art so far as the crowning member of the columns and part of the general\n",
      "effect are concerned. The twisted rope design, the bead-reel-cable design and so on\n",
      "to mark the transitions, the acanthus leaf and palmette and other designs to decorate\n",
      "the abacus may have however been derived from the older and common West-Asiatic\n",
      "art-heritage.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The unerring precision with which these Mauryan pillars were worked and chiseled\n",
      "show that those who quarried and carved them were no novices at their craft, as\n",
      "would have been Indian artificers, but had generations of experience behind them.\n",
      "The shapes and decorative forms employed are few of them indigenous, but on the\n",
      "other hand are obviously derived from the art repertory of another and more advanced\n",
      "people. Such exotic forms are not difficult to identify as some of them are clearly of\n",
      "Greek, others of Persian and a few perhaps of Egyptian extraction. This development\n",
      "of the art of working in stone, therefore, which Ashoka introduced into the country,\n",
      "represents an Indian offshoot of that forceful Graeco-Persian culture which flourished\n",
      "with such vigour in Western Asia some centuries before the Christian era. Thank You.\n",

      "HISTORY OF KUSHANA DYNASTY\n",
      "The Kushana Empire originally formed in the early 1st century A.D. under Kujula\n",
      "Kadphises in the territories of ancient Bactria around the Oxus River (Amu Darya) and\n",
      "later based near Kabul, Afghanistan. They were contemporaneous with the Satvahana\n",
      "(Andhra) and Saka kingdoms during part of the 2nd century A.D. The name Kushana\n",
      "derives from the Chinese term Guishang, used in historical writings to describe one\n",
      "branch of the Yuezhi. The ruling line of the Kushana descended from the Yuezhi, a\n",
      "people that ruled over most of the northern Indian subcontinent, Afghanistan, and parts\n",
      "of central Asia during the first three centuries of the Common Era. The Yuezhi\n",
      "conquered Bactria (northwest Afghanistan and Tajikistan) in the 2nd century B.C. and\n",
      "divided the country into five chiefdoms, one of which was that of the Kushanas\n",
      "(Guishang). A hundred years later the Kushana chief Kujula Kadphises secured the\n",
      "political unification of the Yuezhi kingdom under himself in 1st century A.D. The\n",
      "Kushana Empire spread from the Kabul River Valley to defeat other Central Asian tribes\n",
      "that had previously conquered parts of the northern central Iranian Plateau once ruled\n",
      "by the Parthians.\n",
      "Unlike the political stability of the Mauryan Empire, this period was marked by\n",
      "continuous changes in the boundaries of power and immense cultural and linguistic\n",
      "differences. The only cohesive factor was trade, which has been initiated in the\n",
      "Mauryan period, as a stable government ensured communication between various parts\n",
      "of the empire and encouraged active internal trade. Under the rule of the Kushanas,\n",
      "northwest India and adjoining regions participated both in seagoing trade and in\n",
      "commerce along the Silk Road to China and contact was established with many parts of\n",
      "western Asia and the Mediterranean by means of envoys. This naturally helped foreign\n",
      "trade, and the influx of foreigners, Kushanas, Sakas and the Indo-Greeks, gave even\n",
      "more impetus to trade relations with these areas. Under Kanishka-I and his successors,\n",
      "the Kushana kingdom reached its height. It was acknowledged as one of the four great\n",
      "Eurasian powers of its time (the others being China, Rome and Parthia). The Kushanas\n",
      "were instrumental in spreading Buddhism in Central Asia and China and in developing\n",
      "Mahayana Buddhism and the Gandhara and Mathura schools of art. They became\n",
      "affluent through trade, particularly with Rome, as their large issues of gold coins show.\n",
      "These coins, which exhibit the figures of Greek, Roman, Iranian, Hindu and Buddhist\n",
      "deities and bear inscriptions in adapted Greek letters, are witness to the toleration and\n",
      "to the syncretism in religion and art that prevailed in the Kushana Empire. After the rise\n",
      "of the Sasanian dynasty in Iran and of local powers in northern India, Kushan rule\n",
      "declined.\n",
      "KUSHANA COSTUMES – STYLES AND TYPES\n",
      "SOCIAL & CULTURAL LIFESTYLE OF THE KUSHANS COSTUMES:\n",
      "The Social life under the Kushanas was richer in contents and comprehensive in\n",
      "outlook, and range of activities. This is evident from the sculptures, especially from\n",
      "Mathura suggesting the vivacious side of life full of bustle and activity. Evidence relating\n",
      "to singing, dancing, music and other items of entertainment like dramatic performances\n",
      "and magical shows- providing amusement to many- is afforded by the literature of this\n",
      "period. Inscriptions, recording donations or dedications by pious people for their\n",
      "respective religious orders, enjoin the sharing of merit by all the members of the family.\n",
      "The broader view of life aimed at a harmonious balancing of dharma, artha and kama-\n",
      "spirituality, economic pursuit, and martial happiness. The religious texts of this period\n",
      "have much to offer on the secular aspects, and the Kushana art is also not devoid of\n",
      "social facets of human life in its lighter vein, and marked with a sense of humour.\n",
      "The outward appearance of the people in general is indicative of their taste,\n",
      "status and prosperity. The evidence on this aspect of social life is copious-available\n",
      "from sculptures and literature. There was no uniformity, and the dress varied with region\n",
      "and people.\n",
      "ORIGIN OF TWO STYLES OF COSTUMES UNDER THE KUSHANA DYNASTY:\n",
      "There are two completely distinct styles of costumes in Kushana art:-\n",
      "1. GANDHARA STYLE:\n",
      "Gandhara, in the northern part of empire, was built by craftsmen from eastern\n",
      "Rome who were employed by patrons of Buddhism. These craftsmen brought with them\n",
      "the Greco-Roman style, particularly in the drapery of the sculpture, so that the\n",
      "Buddhists represented there were dressed in the classical Greek and Roman garments,\n",
      "the chiton, rimation, stola, tunica, chlamys, etc.\n",
      "2. MATHURA STYLE:\n",
      "The second style in Kushana art was that which arose in Mathura, the southern\n",
      "capital of the empire. This style was a direct continuation of the native Indian schools of\n",
      "Bharhut and Sanchi.\n",
      "But a clear picture of the actual Kushana costume is seen in the sculpture at\n",
      "Surkh Kotal in Afghanistan, the influence on style there being Parthian (eastern Iranian).\n",
      "The Parthians themselves were of Scythic stock like the Kushanas, and their costume is\n",
      "much the same and resembles closely the portrait of Kanishka, the great Kushana king,\n",
      "found at Mathura. The latter wears, in addition to his tunic and trousers, a fur-lined coat\n",
      "or pustin, which is also seen at Surkh Kotal. As mentioned earlier, there was no\n",
      "uniformity in this period and the dress of the people too varied with each region. The\n",
      "ordinary dress consisted as usual of an antariya, uttariya and kayabandh, with a turban\n",
      "for men. With the advent of the Kushanas this was extended, and the fashion of wearing\n",
      "sewing garments of central Asiatic pattern seems to have made headway with all\n",
      "classes of Indians in north India. The cut and sewn garments, which are rarely visible in\n",
      "the sculptures of the previous periods, are more commonly found in this period.\n",
      "TYPES OF KUSHANA COSTUMES:\n",
      "The Kushana costumes may be divided into five types:\n",
      "1. INDIGENOUS PEOPLE- the antariya, uttariya and kayabandh.\n",
      "2. GUARDIANS AND ATTENDANTS OF THE HAREM- usually the indigenous and sewn\n",
      "kancuka, red-brown in colour.\n",
      "3. FOREIGN KUSHANA RULERS AND THEIR ENTOURAGE.\n",
      "4. OTHER FOREIGHNERS SUCH AS GROOMS, TRADERS.\n",
      "5. MIXTURE OF FOREIGN AND INDIGENOUS GARMENTS-This category is of great\n",
      "interest as it shows how clothes changed and evolved, how some of the purely draped\n",
      "garments of the Indians were replaced by cut-and-sewn garments, especially in north\n",
      "and north-west where influences were felt more keenly, and where climatically sewn\n",
      "garments were more suitable.\n",
      "KUSHANA COSTUMES IN GANDHARA REGION SCULPTURES:\n",
      "In the Gandhara region, the ordinary dress of the people consisted of a loin cloth\n",

      "Afghanistan. The dress was worn by most of Scythian and Iranian races and resembled\n",
      "particularly that of the Parthians. It is consisted of a ruched long-sleeves tunic with a slit\n",
      "for the neck opening, simple or elaborately decorated. The close-fitting knee-length\n",
      "tunic was sometimes made of leather, and with it could be worn a short cloak or a calf-\n",

      "by a belt of leather or metal. Besides there two upper garments, occasionally a third\n",
      "garment the Chugha was used. The Chugha was a coat-like and decorated with a\n",
      "border down the chest and hemline, and had slits to facilitate movement. The trousers\n",
      "could be of linen, silk or muslin in summer but were woolen or quilted in winter. There\n",

      "covering for the breasts. In addition, the typical Indian uttariya is worn across the back\n",

      "THE KUSHANA DYNASTY:\n",
      "Under the Kushana dynasty, for the first time trade with China was directly\n",
      "established through the ancient Silk Route. Indian traders settled down in Chinese\n",
      "Turkestan, which was annexed by Kaniksha, the Kushana king. This included\n",
      "Kashnagar, Khotan and Yarkhand. Buddhists missions too were sent to China. In\n",
      "Rome, Augustus encouraged trade with India and exports increased resulting in a\n",
      "flourishing merchant class. In the northwestern is coarse cotton and wool were used for\n",
      "making tunics and trousers for horsemen, hunters, foreigners and doorkeepers. In\n",
      "central India textiles were of lightweight cotton, tulapansi for making summer clothes\n",
      "and blankets, kambala for winter clothes. Both indigenous and foreign skills were\n",
      "plentiful but still very expensive. The clothes were also perfumed, avasayan. There is\n",
      "reference to dyers known as rajaka in an inscription and in literature.\n",
      "The antariya were very rarely decorated and when they were, they appear to\n",
      "have been embroidered, woven, or printed in diagonal check designs enclosing small\n",
      "circles. Turban cloths for rich women were often diagonally striped with every third line\n",
      "made of pearls. This bejeweled material was also used to cover beds and seats. Many\n",
      "other geometric patterns of checks, stripes and triangles were also printed and woven. It\n",
      "is only from literary sources that we know of the textiles and dyes available in the earlier\n",
      "period. There is no evidence of actual fabrics being made in India before the twelfth and\n",
      "thirteenth century. But a large variety of fabrics were recovered from the burial grounds\n",
      "along the Silk Route, which can be dated to between the 1st century B.C. and the 2nd\n",
      "century A.D. (Han period in China). Based on this evidence we may presume that the\n",
      "dyes and textiles of Chinese origin available along this route would surely have found\n",
      "their way into India. Hence, it is possible to maintain that many of the patterns and\n",
      "colours would be similar, or had influenced indigenous fabrics. We know for a fact that\n",
      "the beautiful ultra-marine and lapis lazuli blue were sent along the trade route from the\n",
      "famous mines at Badakshan in Central Asia. There, in addition, much literary evidence\n",
      "of sophistication of Indian textiles from the earliest times. In a list compiled of fabrics\n",
      "recovered from the ancient Silk Route, fabrics in the following colour were found: bright\n",

      "Under the Gupta Empire, which arose in Bihar around 320 A.D., there was an\n",
      "outpouring of science, literature, music and the visual arts. The empire spread\n",
      "across northern India and lasted over 200 years. It is seen as “India’s\n",

      "Samudragupta, Chandragupta II, Kumargupta and Skandagupta dominate the\n",
      "history of India of the fourth and fifth centuries A.D. Consciously emulating the\n",
      "ancient Mauryan Empire, they established their capital at Patliputra, where\n",
      "they grew in power and importance until they, along with the remnants of\n",
      "Kushana Culture, were finally crushed by the invasion of the White Huns in\n",
      "the last years of the fifth centuries. Originally from eastern Uttar Pradesh,\n",
      "Chandragupta I, extended his rule to Magadha by marrying a Licchavi\n",
      "princess, an event celebrated in a series of gold coins. He was the first of the\n",

      "Great kings’ or ‘Supreme King’. His son Samudragupta was a noted\n",
      "conqueror and his grandson Chandragupta II spread the empire west and\n",
      "southwards with a series of conquests and marriages.\n",
      "The Gupta Period is often described as “The Golden Age of Art and\n",
      "Architecture in India”. During this period the iconographic canons of\n",
      "Brahmanical, Jain and Buddhist divinities were perfected and standardized,\n",
      "which served as ideal models of artistic expression for later centuries, not only\n",
      "in India but also beyond its border. It was an age of all round perfection in\n",
      "domestic life, administration, literature, as seen in the works of Kalidasa, in art\n",
      "creations and in religion and philosophy as exemplified in the wide-spread\n",
      "Bhagavata cult, which identified itself with an intensive cult of beauty.\n",
      "EVOLUTION OF GUPTA STYLE TEMPLE ARCHITECTURE\n",
      "During the Gupta period, a firm foundation of temple architecture was laid\n",
      "when the basic elements of the Indian temple consisting of a square sanctum\n",
      "and pillared porch emerged. The evolved Gupta temple also had a covered\n",
      "processional path for circumambulation that formed a part of the worship-\n",
      "ritual. Earlier temples of the period had a flat slab roof, often monolithic but\n",
      "the later temples in brick and stone developed a Shikhara. The gradual\n",
      "evolution of the Gupta style is traceable through development of the plan and\n",
      "the ornamentation on the pillars and door-frame, the later introducing new\n",
      "decorative motifs like goblins, couples, flying angels, door-keepers and a\n",
      "figure relief in the centre of the lintel emblematic of the deity consecrated in\n",
      "the temple.\n",
      "Sculptures of deities, their consorts, celestial beings, couples, directional\n",
      "deities, composite animals and decorative motifs formed the mass of images\n",
      "that adorned the walls of the temples and their interiors. The deities\n",
      "consecrated in the sanctum were carved strictly according to religious canons\n",
      "and installed by performing a special consecration ceremony. The genius of\n",
      "the Indian Sculptor lay in his visualization of the deities ideal proportions,\n",
      "youthful bodies and benign expressions. Temple sculptures were not\n",
      "necessarily religious. Many drew on secular subject matters and decorative\n",
      "motifs. The scenes of everyday life consist of military processions, royal court\n",
      "scenes, musicians, dancers, acrobats and amorous couples. Another group of\n",

      "glossy glaze was added to it once the seal was ready. Approximately 2000\n",
      "seals have been recovered from various sites in the Indus Valley. The\n",
      "material used to make them is steatite, faience, limestone, clay, ivory and\n",
      "terra cotta. The process was for a Steatite to be cut into the desired shape by\n",
      "a saw. The boss was then rounded off after the groove by a knife and finished\n",
      "off with an abrasive. The design appears to have been cut by a too usually\n",

      "Significance:\n",
      "The main use of the seals was as some form of merchandise and marking on\n",

      "other was selected by a trader for his seal. To this was added a combination\n",
      "of pictographs as required by the merchant to make the seal distinctive.\n",
      "Perhaps the lettering on the seals was no more that varying combinations f\n",
      "well understood symbols so arranged as to differentiate the seal of one trader\n",
      "from that of the other. Seals bearing only a script have also been found and\n",
      "this may suggest that the script was more important in a seal than the animal\n",
      "figurine. Some of these seals may have been used as amulets and some may\n",
      "have had some religious or ritualistic significance.\n",
      "The main settlements of Harappa, Mohenjo- daro, Lothal, etc are at\n",
      "considerable distances from one another and in all probability traded among\n",
      "themselves. The main function of the Indus Valley Seals was not religious but\n",
      "purely economic. The seals were identifying symbols and signs of authority.\n",
      "Wilson J.V. Kinnier (1974) a noted writer says ‘They were not amulets.’ Some\n",
      "scholars are of the opinion that the parent of the Indus Script was the Brahmi\n",
      "Script.\n",
      "The Pictographic Script was not deciphered till late. Some of the characters\n",
      "have been identified. There are about 200 signs that are seen here which can\n",
      "be understood. Some symbols are of a fish, Horn, shell, flower, etc. The\n",
      "pictographic means script containing visuals or pictures.\n",
      "Part of fertility ritual is seen that is depicted on the seals. There is a strong\n",
      "connection to the Nature Gods. The man found answers to his problems from\n",
      "the Mother Nature. The worship of Mother Goddess before beginning any new\n",
      "work was a kind of routine for the devotee. The main Deity was Siva Pasupati,\n",
      "the God of the animals. The animals depicted on the seals have the vibrating\n",
      "and pulsating energy corresponding to the animal depicted therein. The seal\n",
      "was identification and mark of possession on one hand and a cult practice on\n",
      "the other. To impose the protective taboo upon the merchandize too was it’s\n",
      "purpose.\n",
      "Subject Matter:\n",
      "The Indus Valley Seals exhibit the animals like rhinoceros, elephants, tigers,\n",
      "antelope and imaginary animals too, like the Unicorn. The short horned bull,\n",
      "Brahmani bull, gharial, Goat, Bull, etc. were often seen. Seals showing\n",

      "to show the merged powers of both the forms conjoined. Noted Art Historian\n",
      "Stella Kramrisch says ‘There are peculiar associations of the tree with the\n",
      "human figure where from Indian motifs might have evolved.’ Several seals are\n",
      "Ithyphallic which means more than three heads. A goat is seen from Indus\n",
      "with three heads carved on the seal. The goat head seems to be in movement\n",
      "left, right and center. Multiplicity of the heads is depicted to highlight the\n",
      "power of the Deity and the animal. The few important seals are as follows:\n",
      "Mother Goddess Sealing:\n",
      "It is made of steatite which is portrayed by a semi- nude female figure of the\n",
      "mother. The mother is being worshiped for fertility. She is shown wearing a\n",
      "girdle around her loins. The head- dress is elaborate. Mother Goddess is\n",
      "shown as the Tutelary Goddess. The large seal represents a goddess among\n",
      "the leaves of an Asvatha tree. The hair dress is suggestive of a lunar divinity.\n",
      "In the fore ground is a similar figure in adoration that seems to be dragging a\n",
      "bull like being with a half human head and zig zag horns to be sacrificed.\n",
      "Seven attendants in characteristic costumes follow with a saddle cloth.\n",
      "Upturned Female Figure:\n",
      "A woman is shown upside down on the seal. A plant is shown issuing from\n",
      "her womb. Human sacrifice seems to take place in front of the Earth\n",
      "Goddess. A river is seen gushing out from the mother’s womb. The bifurcated\n",
      "branch of a Pipal tree depicts Mother Goddess. The goat seems to have been\n",
      "shown in one corner. A pictographic script which is inclusive of images and\n",
      "symbols seems to be indicative of the illustration on it. As the script is not\n",
      "entirely deciphered so far there is much controversy amongst scholars on\n",
      "what the script says. The visual is dominant and self- explanatory to the\n",
      "thoughts of the artist.\n",
      "3 Faced Deity:\n",
      "Siva is a divine Yogi and as such derives his power from Yoga rather than\n",
      "from sacrifices. Plant and animal fertility was considered the boons emanating\n",
      "from the worship of Siva. Bull is identified as his vehicle. A Deity is seen\n",
      "seated cross- legged with a horned head- dress. He is referred to as the Tri-\n",
      "cephalous God as he is adorned with three horns. The phallus is in erection\n",
      "and the 7 letters of the pictographic script are seen to emphasize perhaps the\n",
      "7 rivers. The animals that surround the Deity are elephant, tiger, buffalo, deer\n",
      "and rhinoceros. This seal can be understood as the Tri- mukha, Pasupati,\n",
      "Yogisvara or Maha Yogi. The seated Yogi is seated in Padmasana, which\n",
      "unmistakably links to Siva. He is shown in inverted perspective as he is\n",
      "depicted much larger in size than the animals accompanying Him. The Deity\n",
      "is worshipped for fertility and protection highlighting the iconic and phallic\n",
      "worship.\n",
      "Stella Kramrisch says concerning the understanding of the seals that ‘Other\n",
      "devices on the seals and sealings on terra cotta are also relevant, if as motifs\n",
      "only, for the future, the centrifugal combination of various figure or their parts\n",
      "diverging from one center. The many headed divinity and the standing figure\n",
      "with long arms so that they touch the knees, the over high heads of the\n",
      "Goddess which anticipates the Ushnisha, the mode of sitting, the part played\n",
      "by the Naga (serpent) and the alignment of the repeated figures, as well as\n",
      "freely symmetrical arrangement of single figure on the surface of the relief.’\n",
      "This emphasizes how the artist created his work. He was inspired by the\n",
      "Nature and he had no academic training to draw the motifs. But by instinct\n",
      "and reverence he created them on the surface.\n",
      "Seal with a Unicorn:\n",
      "Humped Bull is seen that appears to be like an ordinary bull but yet is a\n",
      "fraction of an imagination of the artist. The seal representing the big humped\n",
      "bull is shown with crescent horns and thick, heavy dewlap. It was found from\n",
      "Mahenjodaro. There is seen a vigorous dynamism in the form. The powerful\n",

      "energy was exuded through it’s powerful horns. The muscles seem to ripple\n",

      "over- crowding of the forms. The compositions were proportionate in depiction\n",
      "and did not focus only on the idealization of the form. It seemed that they\n",
      "modeled them with their hand. The figurines were solid with naturalistic\n",
      "representation.\n",
      "The animal engravings on the seals are often of high order and evoke our\n",
      "admiration. Seal engraving was a specialized craft in these trading\n",
      "settlements and the demand for this accessory of commerce often lead to the\n",
      "making of the seals with intaglio of real artistic merit. The seals are mostly of\n",
      "steatite. At Lothal the sealings were found to be baked in a brick kiln and were\n",
      "known to facilitate their use on the merchandise. The hole in the seal was for\n",

      "medieval period with a comparative analysis of Hindu and Islamic architecture.\n",
      "Introduction\n",
      "The medieval period saw great developments in the field of architecture. With\n",
      "the coming of Muslims to India, many new features came to be introduced in\n",
      "buildings. The development of Muslim Style of Architecture of this period can be\n",
      "called the Indo-Islamic Architecture or the Indian Architecture influenced by\n",
      "Islamic Art and this style was neither strictly Islamic nor strictly Hindu.\n",
      "The contacts of the Muslims with India were the result of a series of armed raids\n",
      "and invasions through the north-west passes from the 8th to the 18th centuries.\n",
      "The Muslim invaders were of different origins- Arab, Turk, Afghan, and Mughal.\n",
      "Mohammed of Ghazni, Mohammed of Ghor, the Mamluks and the Tughlaqs\n",
      "were Turks; the Khaljis were Afghan-Turks, the Lodis and Surs were Afghans;\n",
      "and the Mughals were Largely Turks and partly Mongols.\n",
      "The coming of the Muslims brought a new and invigorating influence into Indian\n",
      "art. This Islamic style of architecture was not completely new. When a Hindu city\n",
      "was captured, the Muslims hurriedly built a mosque with materials from\n",
      "destroyed Hindu temples. While the Muslims supervised - as they were mainly\n",
      "soldiers and not artists - the Hindus did the actual work. Therefore traces of\n",
      "Hindu influence can readily be detected in these monuments from the very\n",
      "beginning. Yet the design of the architecture was truly Islamic and strikingly\n",
      "contrasted with the Hindu art.\n",
      "Significance\n",
      "The fundamental Islamic dogma is the unity of God or Allah. The supreme\n",
      "revelation is the Quran, dictated to Mohammad. As the book of law, the Quran\n",
      "spells out the conditions for submission (Islam) and the consequent moral\n",
      "obligations of the believer (muslim), the Five Pillars of Islam: affirmation of the\n",
      "Creed, prayer, fasting, alms giving and pilgrimage. Thus, it is the requirement for\n",
      "prayer that constitute the prime progenitor of architecture in Islam.\n",
      "Subject Matter\n",
      "The most important buildings in Islam are religious in function like the mosques\n",
      "and tombs or secular like the palaces and halls.\n",
      "Mosque\n",
      "The Koran prescribes a precise ritual, including prostration on a mat protecting\n",
      "the worshipper from the impurities of the ground, for individual prayer five times\n",
      "daily and congregation prayer at noon on Friday. Orientation was dictated by the\n",
      "designation of Mecca- the place of Abraham’s sacrifice and Muhammad’s birth -\n",
      "as the axis of prayer or qibla marked by the cubical Kaaba which stands for the\n",
      "first building dedicated to God, by Abraham’s son Ismail. While formal provision\n",
      "is often made for the modest area required in individual or family worship, the\n",
      "principal place of worship i.e. a mosque must accommodate the considerable\n",
      "number of mats involved at community level in the Friday (juma) noon prayers\n",
      "(hence the juma-or jami-masjid) .\n",
      "In plan every mosque is based on that of Mecca, but Islamic culture enriched\n",
      "itself by contacts with the older cultures of the Middle East. Greater elaboration\n",
      "of design developed, and new architectural features appeared in the fully\n",
      "evolved mosque in India. Mosque or masjid literally means place of prostration.\n",
      "It consists of the sihn, an open rectangular courtyard with a fountain for ablutions\n",
      "in the centre. It is surrounded by the liwan, a pillared cloister, with several\n",
      "entrances. Since the Muslim has to face Mecca when prostrating in prayer, a\n",

      "towards Mecca, if possible in a vaulted chamber allowing the incumbent room to\n",
      "sit up when called to account. Islamic tomb architecture in India developed\n",
      "parallel with that of the mosque. The tomb consists usually of the hujra, a square\n",
      "building with one chamber standing on a raised platform and crowned by a\n",
      "gumbad or dome. In the centre of the hujra stands the zarih or cenotaph –\n",
      "possibly more than one, if a number of people are buried below. This is always a\n",
      "rectangular structure, placed exactly above the actual qabr or grave in the\n",
      "maqbara or the chamber below. The western wall of the hujra usually contains a\n",
      "mihrab. The ziarats which are the tombs of Muslim saints are often surrounded\n",
      "by mosques, pilgrim-halls and other tombs, forming a Dargah which is a place of\n",
      "pilgrimage.\n",
      "In the early periods, the tombs resembled fortresses built of red sandstone,\n",
      "surrounded as they were by high, solid walls. In the Mughal period however they\n",
      "were set in splendid gardens and became much more refined in structure.\n",
      "Finally marble replaced red sandstone. Notable among the tombs of the early\n",
      "Mughal period is that of Humayun in Delhi, while among the later marble\n",
      "edifices, the most outstanding is the Taj Mahal at Agra.\n",
      "Idgah and Madrasa\n",
      "Minor religious buildings are the idgah and the madrasa. The idgah is actually a\n",
      "large open space meant to accommodate the large crowds which gather for\n",
      "common prayer on the day of Id-ul-Fitr, with a long wall on the side facing\n",
      "Mecca, containing prayer-niches and perhaps a pulpit. The madrasa on the\n",
      "other hand is a school or college for teaching of Islamic doctrine. It resembles\n",
      "the mosque from which it originates, except that the central hall and most of the\n",
      "entrances are replaced by lecture-halls.\n",
      "Mahal\n",
      "Secular buildings are based on the khana (house) which has a central courtyard\n",
      "around which are aiwans or halls with dalan or verandas all facing inwards. The\n",
      "mardana or men’s quarters are always separated from the haram or zananas\n",
      "which are the women’s habitation. A mahal is a building for rich people and the\n",
      "plan of these consists of the multiplication of the simple khana. Namely, there\n",

      "(the richly painted rooms) and sish-mahals (the mirrored halls) are set aside for\n",
      "special occasions. A hawa-mahal, meaning mansion of air or wind, consists of\n",
      "open upper terraces. There are underground rooms called sardabs or tehkhana,\n",
      "with a well in the vicinity or even a water tank above them, to cool the palaces\n",
      "during the hot season. In the royal palace there are in addition the Diwan-i-am\n",
      "meaning the hall of public audience, the Diwan-i-khas which is the hall of private\n",
      "audience and the darbar which served on very solemn occasions.\n",
      "Gardens\n",
      "The garden design was another secular art much cultivated by Mughals. The\n",
      "bagh or gardens of the Mughals are world famous. Some of these formal\n",
      "gardens can still be seen in Kashmir. The plan of the garden was generally\n",
      "square or rectangular when it was called Char-bagh. The beautiful flower-beds\n",
      "were separated by water channels radiating out from the central pool. Often\n",
      "artificial waterfalls and illuminated fountains surrounded the kushk which is the\n",
      "garden place, at the end of the garden, which consisted of several baradari or\n",
      "pillared rooms. The water channel terminated in the bhavan or the airy halls. Burj\n",
      "or towers were built at the corners of the enclosure, with domed colonnaded\n",
      "chatris.\n",
      "Characteristics\n",
      "Indo-Islamic style is usually divided into three phases: (1) the Delhi Sultanate or\n",
      "Pashtun style, (2) the Provincial, and (3) the Mughal.\n",
      "(1)The Delhi Sultanate or Pashtun style : Examples of the earlier Pashtun style\n",
      "in stone are at Ahmadabad in Gujarat State, and in brick at Gaur-Pandua in\n",
      "West Bengal State. These structures are closely allied to Hindu models, but are\n",
      "simpler and lack sculpture of human figures. The dome, the arch, and the\n",
      "minaret are constant features of the style; a famous monument in this style is the\n",
      "mausoleum Gol Gumbaz of 17th century in Bijapur, Mysore State, which has a\n",
      "dome 43 m in diameter, almost as big as that of St Peter’s basilica in Rome.\n",
      "Another notable structure is the five-storey stone and marble tower\n",
      "called the Qutub Minar .Qutub Minar a tower of victory rather than a religious\n",
      "structure. Originally 73 metre high, is without equal in India, or indeed anywhere\n",
      "else in the Islamic world. It was of four diminishing storeys separated by\n",
      "projecting balconies, each stage different in section – stellate, with convex flutes,\n",
      "or with a combination of the two; the round topmost element may represent a\n",
      "14th century rebuilding. The Qutb Minar is distinguished from all other buildings\n",
      "of its type not only by its size but also by its work-manship, with bands of richly\n",
      "carved inscription from the Quran and superb stalactite bracketing under the\n",
      "balconies.\n",
      "(2)The Provincial style reflected the continued rebellion of the provinces against\n",
      "the imperial style of Delhi. The best example of this phase is in Gujarat, where\n",
      "for almost two centuries until 1572, when Emperor Akbar finally conquered the\n",
      "region, the dynasties that succeeded one another erected many monuments in\n",
      "varying styles. The most notable structures in this phase are found in the capital,\n",
      "Ahmadabad.\n",
      "Ahmadabad, founded in 1411 by Ahmad Shah I, was eventually to boast\n",
      "upwards of fifty mosques of which the finest, the Jami Masjid, finished in 1423, is\n",
      "perhaps the most aesthetically satisfying in the whole of India. Plainly visible\n",
      "through the central arch of the façade, flanked by two beautifully proportioned\n",
      "fluted minarets, are tall, slender, closely set pillars supporting three storeys of\n",
      "balconies and platforms. Through a suspended andola torana of impeccable\n",
      "Hindu design the colonnaded hall is entered, stretching for 64 m on either side of\n",
      "the central area, two storeys high and partly divided off by perforated stone\n",
      "screens. At one end is the zenana, set apart for women. Support is by stone\n",
      "beams rather than by arches and yet the general effect is one of lightness,\n",
      "recalling the contemporary temples of Rajasthan, with their raised halls.\n",
      "(3)The Mughal phase of the indo-Islamic style, from the 16th to the 18th century,\n",
      "developed to a high degree the use of such luxurious materials as marble. The\n",
      "culminating example of the style is the Taj Mahal in Agra. This domed\n",
      "mausoleum of white marble inlaid with gemstones was built from 1632 to 1648\n",
      "by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his beloved wife. Entering\n",
      "through a large gateway, the visitor first sees the tomb at the end of a long\n",
      "garden watered by a wide canal interrupted by a fountain with large square\n",
      "basins. The mausoleum itself, dramatically sited on a buff overlooking the\n",
      "Yamuna, is faced on either side by two identical buildings, one a mosque, the\n",
      "other a jawab or ‘answer’ without religious significance. with its central arch,\n",
      "deeply embayed like the smaller superimposed arches in the wings, the two\n",
      "large chhatris balancing the raised dome on each side, and the high blind-\n",
      "arched plinth, the Taj brings together all the themes of Mughal architecture to\n",
      "form a superbly proportioned and balanced whole. The marble work is\n",
      "magnificent, saved by certain touches from any hint of banality. Exceptionally,\n",
      "the four minarets at the corners of the podium, perfectly placed, are rusticated,\n",
      "and their little domes are not bulbous.\n",
      "Another important example of this style is the Humayun’s mausoleum in Delhi\n",
      "built in 1565, raised largely by the unremitting efforts of a devoted widow,\n",
      "inaugurates the Mughal tradition, derived from their Persian heritage, of building\n",
      "tombs in vast formal gardens with important entrance buildings. The tomb itself\n",
      "also owes much to contemporary Persia. Set on a vast high podium containing\n",
      "rooms, it is a fore-taste of the Taj Mahal, with its great central bayed arch,\n",
      "flanking wings with arches of the same kind, its raised domed and its chhatris.\n",
      "Only the tall minarets are missing, and the facing is of red sandstone.\n",
      "Other famous examples of the Mughal style are the Pearl Mosque at Agra, Uttar\n",
      "Pradesh State, the palace fortresses at Agra and Delhi, and the great mosques\n",
      "at Delhi and Lahore (now in Pakistan).\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "The most important factors common to both forms of architecture, especially in\n",
      "respect of mosques and temples, were that to both styles, ornamental\n",
      "decoration was very vital and that the open court in many cases was surrounded\n",
      "by colonnades. But the contrast was equally striking: the prayer chamber of the\n",
      "mosque was spacious, whereas the shrine of the temple was comparatively\n",
      "small. The mosque was light and open, whereas the temple was dark and\n",
      "closed. The difference between the lay-out of a temple and a mosque is\n",
      "explained by the essential difference between the Hindu and Muslim forms of\n",
      "worship and prayer. A cell to house the image of the deity, garbha-griha, and\n",
      "often small halls in front for the worshippers was regarded adequate for a simple\n",
      "Hindu temple. But the Islamic form of worship, with its emphasis on\n",
      "congregational prayer, requires a spacious courtyard with a large prayer hall,\n",
      "pointed towards Mecca, as its western end that is, to the West of India. In the\n",
      "rear wall of the prayer-hall, the centre is occupied by a recess or alcove, called\n",
      "mihrab; and indicates the direction of prayer (quibla). A pulpit (mimber) at its\n",
      "right is meant for the imam who leads the prayer. A tower or minaret, originally\n",
      "intended for the muazzin to call the faithful to the prayer, later assumed a mere\n",
      "architectural character. A gallery or compartment of the prayer hall or some\n",
      "other part was screened off to accommodate the ladies who observed purdah.\n",
      "The main entrance to a mosque is on the east, and the sides are enclosed by\n",
      "cloisters (liwans). A tank is provided for ablutions usually in the courtyard of a\n",
      "mosque.\n",
      "The mode, theme or motifs or ornamentation employed in Islamic buildings also\n",
      "made a departure from the earlier vogues. The Hindu style or ornamentation is\n",
      "largely naturalistic showing human and animal forms and the luxuriant\n",
      "vegetation life. As among the Muslims the representation of living beings was\n",
      "taboo by way of decoration or ornamentation, they introduced geometrical and\n",
      "arabesque patterns, ornamental writing and formal representation of plant and\n",
      "floral life. In short the contribution of the Muslims to Indo-Muslim architecture is\n",
      "profound and no less interesting. Among the architectural features introduced by\n",
      "them mention may be made of arches, domes, minars and minarets, the\n",
      "pendentive, squinch arch, half domed double portals, kiosks or chhatris and the\n",
      "use of concrete as a factor of construction. They also introduced gilding and\n",
      "painting in varied colours and designs. Muslim decorative elements are usually\n",
      "of the nature of embroidery. Even though lime was known and to certain extent\n",
      "used in construction work in India fairly early, mud was generally used for brick\n",
      "work and large blocks of stones were laid one on top of the other and held by\n",
      "means of iron clamps. The Muslims, like the Romans, were also responsible for\n",
      "making extensive use of concrete and lime mortar as an important factor of\n",
      "construction and incidentally used lime as plaster and a base for decoration\n",
      "which was incised into it and held enamel work on tiles.\n",
      "There was gradually a harmonious blending between the Hindu and Muslim\n",
      "architectural styles and this new style of architecture is known as Indo-Islamic. It\n",
      "is entirely different in character from Muslim architecture in other countries,\n",
      "incorporating the best of both Hindu and, Muslim styles. It was in this direction\n",
      "that the Indo-Islamic Architecture now began to evolve, adding to it the local\n",
      "flavour of the provisional kingdom of Bengal, Gujarat, Jaunpur, Golconda, Malwa\n",
      "and the Deccan.\n",
      "Summary\n",
      "The medieval period saw great developments in the field of architecture. With\n",
      "the coming of Muslims to India, many new features came to be introduced in\n",
      "buildings. There was gradually a harmonious blending between the Hindu and\n",
      "Muslim architectural styles and this new style of architecture is known as Indo-\n",
      "Islamic. The fundamental Islamic dogma is the unity of God or Allah and it is the\n",
      "requirement for prayer that constitute the prime progenitor of architecture in\n",
      "Islam. Indo-Islamic style is usually divided into three phases: the Delhi Sultanate\n",
      "or Pashtun style, the Provincial, and the Mughal. Thus the Indo-Islamic\n",
      "architecture is entirely different in character from Muslim architecture in other\n",

      "essentially developed under Chandra Gupta Maurya from the North to Central India. The\n",
      "time period was approximately 322- 185 BC. The territory under the Mauryan Empire\n",
      "was prosperous and had extensive trade with foreign Countries. It would be appropriate\n",

      "Kandhar and Baluchistan which brought the Western boundaries of Magadha up to the\n",
      "Hindu Kush.\n",
      "Emperor Asoka ruled from 272-232 B.C He embraced Buddhism after the deadly\n",
      "battle of Kalinga and thereafter actively patronized the developments of arts, literature,\n",
      "lats or columns and monuments. Chandra Gupta Maurya encouraged the Cultural\n",
      "exchange with the Greek World where Asoka is known for his monolithic lats or columns\n",
      "and monumental character of contribution. These columns were known for their\n",
      "Prespolitan polish (named after a small town in Iran) that made the surface shine like\n",
      "black jade.\n",
      "The administration under the Kushanas was very well managed. It extended from\n",
      "Balkh and Khotan to Bihar in the East; Kashmir in the North to Upper SIndh in the\n",
      "South- West. The Kushana rulers followed the pattern of the Achaemenian Satrapies.\n",
      "To this category belonged Maha Kshatrapa, Kharapallana, Kshtrapa- Vanaspara,\n",
      "Kshatrapa- Liaka and few others whose names are noticed in Kushana records. The\n",
      "sources are the Buddhist Literature and Pali works like Milindapanha. The Kushana\n",
      "monarchs seemed to possess unfettered powers. There was known a council that\n",
      "used to assist the King in its functions as revealed in the Buddhist texts.\n",
      "Significance:\n",
      "By the understanding of Chandragupta Maurya’s Empire we get a glimpse into the\n",
      "kind of administration that was prevalent. The Empire was divided into 3 provinces,\n",
      "each under a Viceroy, usually under the Royal family. The provincial capitals were\n",
      "at Taxilla, Ujjain and Tosali. He visited law courts and Hall of Audience (Diwan- i-\n",
      "Aam. Diwan- i- Khaas). Hunting was his favorite sport and his army consisted of\n",
      "elephants, chariots and cavalry. According to Megathenes’s observation ‘All land\n",
      "belonged to the state. There was no private ownership in the state, famines were\n",
      "unknown and Irrigation received special interest. There was over all prosperity. The\n",
      "ruler was assisted in his duties by his ministers who took charge of various port- folios.\n",
      "There was significant importance given to trade. The second board took care of the\n",
      "Foreign office and consulate, medical facilities, stamped with their passports,\n",
      "etc. The third board took care of registrations of Births and Deaths in the state and\n",
      "maintained the census for taxation purposes. There were boards in charge of\n",
      "commerce, regulated sales, stamped weights and measures, collection of tax, etc.\n",
      "Civil and criminal courts existed separately. Cases were heard by three judges. The\n",
      "main articles in which the merchants dealt were muslins, finer clothes, cutlery, armor,\n",
      "brocades, embroideries and drugs. Ivory, gold and jewelry too were some of the other\n",
      "articles.\n",
      "The society and economic activity reveals that there was centralized\n",
      "bureaucracy or the control of the state over economy was predominant. Early pastoral\n",
      "economy had change to a village economy based on agriculture. According to the\n",
      "account of Megasthenes the Indian Society was divided into 7 classes of philosophers,\n",
      "farmers, soldiers, herdsmen, artisans, magistrates and Councilors. Strabo a noted\n",
      "writer maintains that the cultivators received one- quarter of the produce from tbe king\n",
      "as a payment. The cultivators formed the majority of Indian population. The possibility\n",
      "of land ownership in Mauryan Society is five: The King, The State, Large Scale land\n",
      "owners, Communal ownership and Cultivators. A noted Historian Romilla Thapar\n",
      "mentions about the writings of Fick, drawing attention to the frequent references to\n",
      "gahapatis and gama bhojakas in the Jatakas.Both of whom appear to control large\n",
      "areas of land.\n",
      "Arthashastra describes the buildings within the city that sheds more lights on social\n",
      "status of various professions. Wages were determined according to the quality of the\n",
      "work and the quantity produced. For example consider the wages of a weaver for\n",
      "instance, it was dependent on whether the threads were spun fine, coarse or of middle\n",
      "quality and in proportion of the quantity. In a place like Taxilla, the Indian craftsmen\n",
      "would also be in contact with the Iranian craftsman who already was familiar with the\n",
      "medium of stone. The Trade and sale of the merchandise was strictly supervised by\n",
      "the state. As far as Taxes are concerned there is no mention of the capital punishment\n",
      "for such a crime. The punishment was usually confiscation of the goods or the payment\n",
      "of fine.\n",

      "between the members of the same caste. Dress and ornaments Sculptures and\n",
      "Literature are rich sources of knowing the status, taste and prosperity of the\n",
      "people.\n",
      "In the Gandhara region the dress of the people consisted of a loin cloth (dhoti)tied with\n",

      "girdle on her pelvis. The ornamentation consisted of a necklace for both men and\n",
      "women. Men wore a single bangle but for women the bangles were numerous. From the\n",
      "sculptures available it seems soft and transparent clothing was worn during summers\n",
      "and perhaps plain cotton (tunda pati) was worn during the winter. The toilet and the\n",
      "treatment of the hair is elaborately seen in the art works found. Asvaghosha mentions\n",
      "about toilet scene where a woman is seen holding up a mirror to her face. Ointment,\n",

      "Brahmanical hierarchy was recognized and practiced. The popular cult of snake\n",

      "While throwing light on the contribution of Bhagat Kabir some basic and general\n",
      "questions which often come to our mind are: From which region of India Bhagat\n",
      "Kabir hailed? During which period his work and thought philosophy influences the\n",
      "Bhakti movement? What are his significant literary contributions? His teachings are\n",
      "placed on which principles and how he was instrumental in bringing about a\n",
      "change in the spiritual, philosophical and social perspectives of India during his\n",
      "life‐time?\n",
      "Of the religious reformers who followed the trail of Ramananda, simplifying and\n",
      "liberalizing his teachings and thereby making the Bhakti movement more\n",
      "meaningful and responsive to social urges, the greatest undoubtedly was Kabir. He\n",
      "was probably the most cosmopolitan of the bhagats of medieval India. Macauliffe\n",
      "says: ‘Kabir has written works which all religious denominations can accept, and\n",
      "which, if perused without bigotry, are advantageous for the salvation of all\n",
      "persons.’ Dedicated to steadfast utterance of God’s name, he ‘deemed worthless\n",
      "the rules of caste and the Hindu and Muhammadan religious observances.’\n",
      "The name Kabir comes from Arabic al‐kabir which means ‘The Great‐the 37th\n",
      "name of God in Islam. Kabir, the most radical disciple of Ramananda, gave a\n",
      "positive shape to the social philosophy of his illustrious teacher. He believed in\n",
      "formless God. He was the first to reconcile Hinduism and Islam. He preached a\n",
      "religious system strictly monotheistic, taught the absolute abolition of the caste.\n",
      "Kabir was neither a theologian nor a philosopher but he appears before us as a\n",
      "teacher. The central theme of Kabir’s teaching is Bhakti “Kabir refused neither to\n",
      "acknowledge caste distinction nor to recognize the authority of the six schools of\n",
      "Hindu philosophy, or the four divisions of life prescribed by the Brahmans. Kabir\n",
      "played the important role of a teacher and social reformer by the medium of his\n",
      "writings. Apart from having an important influence on Sikhism, Kabir’s legacy is\n",
      "today carried forward by the ‘Kabir Panth’ (‘Path of Kabir’), a religious community\n",
      "that recognizes him as its founder and is one of the Sant Mat sects. Its members\n",
      "known as Kabirpanthis, are spread over north and central India.\n",
      "HIS BIRTH:‐\n",
      "There are so many views are their regarding life history of Kabir:\n",
      "1• There are many legends associated with the birth and death of Kabir (1440‐\n",
      "1518 A.D.). Some people say that, he was born to a family of Muslim weavers.\n",
      "Others claim that he was the son of a Brahmin widow.\n",
      "2• It is widely accepted that he was born in 1398 A.D. (71 years before Guru\n",
      "Nanak). Kabirpanthis (followers of Kabir) say that he lived upto the age of\n",
      "120 years and give date of his death as 1518, but relying on the research of Hazari\n",
      "Prasad Trivedi, a British Scholar Charlotte Vaudeville is inclined to lend credence\n",
      "to these dates. Which has proven that 1448 A.D. is probably the correct date of\n",
      "Saint Kabir’s demise.\n",
      "3• Kabir was born in Benaras and adopted by Neeru and his wife Neema who\n",
      "belonged to julaha community, who named him Kabir (‘Great’ or ‘the Most High’).\n",
      "He seems to have followed his hereditary occupation i.e., weaving,without adopting\n",
      "the ascetic ways of a faqir. It is clear whether he ever married, but tradition gives\n",
      "him a wife named Loi and two children. Kabir had a son who was named Kamal and\n",
      "a daughter named Kamali.\n",
      "4• Kabir strove to create spirit of harmony between the Hindus and the Muslims.\n",
      "His early life is shrouded in mystery. It is said that he was born of a Hindu widow,\n",
      "who left him on the embankment of a tank in Benaras and that he\n",
      "was then found and adopted by a Muslim weaver named Niru. When he grew up\n",
      "and became disciple of Ramananda. He did not leave his home. He was a pious\n",
      "householder and used to earn his livelihood by weaving clothes.\n",
      "5• Kabir’s family is believed to have lived in the locality of ‘Kabir Chaura’ in\n",
      "Varanasi. ‘Kabir matha’, a matha located in the back alleys of Kabir Chaura,\n",
      "celebrates his life and times. Accompanying the property is a house named\n",
      "‘Niru tila’ which houses Niru and Nima’s graves. The house also accommodates\n",
      "students and scholars who lived there and study Kabir’s work.\n",
      "6• The legendary version of Kabir’s first contact with Ramananda is a curious one.\n",
      "Originally Kabir hesitated to ask Ramananda to adopt him as his disciple due to\n",
      "the rigid caste system of the Hindus. Ramananda stayed in his cottage all day and\n",
      "only left it at about 3 o’clock in the morning to go down to the Ganges River to\n",
      "have a bath and perform his rites. Kabir had the knowledge of Ramananda’s daily\n",
      "habits and so he waited one night for Ramananda by lying on the steps of\n",
      "Panchganga Ghat. When Ramananda accidentally stepped on Kabir on his way to\n",
      "bathe, he uttered “Utho! Ram ko Ram bolo” (Rise up! Say Ram to Ram). This\n",
      "became for Kabir, the sacred mantra. Ramananda later give him formal Diksha\n",
      "and accepted him as his disciple.\n",
      "PHILOSOPHY OF KABIR:‐\n",
      "Kabir was influenced by the prevailing religious mood of his times, such as\n",
      "Brahmanic Hinduism, Hindu and Buddhist Tantrism, the teachings of Nath yogis\n",
      "and the personal devotionalism of South India mixed with the imageless God of\n",
      "Islam. The basic religious principles he espoused are very simple. According to\n",
      "Kabir, all life is interplay of two spiritual principles. One is the personal soul\n",
      "(Jivatma) and the other is God (Paramatma). It is Kabir’s view that salvation is the\n",
      "process of bringing these two divine principles into union.\n",
      "His greatest work is the Bijak (The Seedling), an idea of the fundamental one. This\n",
      "collection of poems elucidates Kabir’s universal view of spirituality. Though his\n",
      "vocabulary is replete with Hindu spiritual concepts, such as Brahman, Karma and\n",
      "reincarnation, he vehemently opposed dogmas, both in Hinduism and in Islam. His\n",
      "Hindi was a vernacular, straightforward kind, much like his philosophies. He often\n",
      "advocated leaving aside the Quran and Vedas and simply following Sehaja Path,\n",
      "or Simple/Natural way to oneness in God. He believed in the Vedantic concept of\n",
      "Atman, but unlike earlier orthodox Vedantins, he spurned the Hindu societal caste\n",
      "system and murti‐poojan (Idol worship), showing clear belief in both Bhakti and\n",
      "Sufi ideas. The major part of Kabir’s work as a bhagat was collected by the fifth\n",
      "Sikh Guru‐Guru Arjan Dev and incorporated into the Sikh scripture‐Sri Guru Granth\n",
      "Sahib.\n",
      "POETRY OF KABIR:‐\n",
      "Kabir composed in a condensed and earthy style, replete with surprise and\n",
      "inventive imagery. His poems resonate with praise for the true guru who reveals\n",
      "the divine through direct experience, and denounce more usual ways of attempting\n",
      "god‐union such as chanting, austerities, etc. Kabir, being illiterate, expressed his\n",
      "poems orally in vernacular Hindi, borrowing from various dialects including Avadhi,\n",
      "Braj and Bhojpuri. Kabir’s teachings are contained in his Dohas. The devotional\n",
      "songs or Bhajans of Kabir called Kabir Doha. These Dohas are in the form of short\n",
      "poems in the Bijaka, sacred book of the Kabirpanthis, the followers of Kabir. His\n",
      "devotional Bhajans or Dohas appealed most to the common men, Hindus as well\n",
      "as Muslims.\n",
      "A considerable body of poetical work has been attributed to Kabir. And while two of\n",
      "his disciples‐Bhagodas and Dharamdas, did write much of it down, “there is also\n",
      "much that must have passed with expected changes and distortions, from mouth to\n",
      "mouth, as part of a well‐established oral tradition.\n",
      "Kabir and his followers named his poetic output as Banis (utterances). These\n",
      "include songs as above and couplets called variously Dohas, Saloka (Sanskrit\n",
      "Sloka) or Sakhi (Sanskrit Saksi). The later term meaning ‘witness’ best indicates\n",
      "the use that Kabir and his followers envisioned for these poems: “As direct\n",
      "evidence of the Truth, a Sakhi is meant to be memorized. A Sakhi is meant to\n",
      "evoke the highest Truth.” As such memorizing, reciting and thus pondering over\n",
      "these utterances constitutes, for Kabir and his followers, a path to spiritual\n",
      "awakening.\n",
      "IMPORTANT FEATURES OF KABIR’S POETRY:‐\n",
      "1• Kabir’s poetry has ecstatic feeling and its rejection of both Hinduism and\n",
      "Islam in favor of a direct relationship with the divine.\n",
      "2• Kabir used many kinds of imagery to convey ideas of religious ecstasy, but very\n",
      "common among them are images of music (especially ‘unstuck’ or unsounded\n",
      "music).\n",
      "3• Kabir pointed to the inward life of the mind as the source of contact with the\n",

      "VALLABHA’S MARRIAGE AND FAMILY LIFE: -\n",
      "Shortly before or after this event, Vallabhachraya married at Benaras a\n",
      "Brahmin girl by name Maha Lakshmi. Vallabhacharya, like the other reforming\n",
      "Vaishnavas of the day, seems to have taught that marriage and family were no\n",

      "marriage; the first named Gopinatha being born in 1511 A.D. and the second\n",
      "Vittalnathji born in 1516 A.D., in the village of Parvat. Vallabhacharya himself\n",
      "educated both his sons thus fitting them for their work as his successors in\n",
      "preaching the Vaishnavite cult. At Benaras, Vallabhacharya seems to have divided\n",
      "his time between Benaras and Brindavan partly residing at one place and partly at\n",

      "Madhavendra Puri and disclosed the ‘Brahma Sambandha’ (Sanskrit for - “Relation\n",
      "with Brahman, the supreme Godhead”) a mantra of self dedication or consecration of\n",
      "self to Krishna. During that time Damodardasa was sleeping next to him. In the early\n",

      "disciple, Damodardasa and asked him- “Damala, did you hear any voice last night”?\n",
      "Damodardasa replied that “I heard something but was not able to understand the\n",
      "meaning of it.” Vallabhacharya then explained the meaning of the mantra and at that\n",
      "time he became the first Vaishnava initiated by Vallabhacharya. He wanted to\n",
      "preach his message of devotion to God and God’s grace called “Pushti-Marga”. He\n",
      "undertook three pilgrimages of India. He performed the initiation ceremony of\n",

      "and are the chief authority of his sect in writing these works, mostly commentaries\n",
      "and short philosophical or devotional treatises; Vallabhacharya seems to have been\n",
      "aided by some scholars, perhaps his disciples. These works embody\n",
      "Vallabhacharya’s special version of the Vaishnavite Philosophy and his notions of\n",
